            <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">1.</span> Which of the following is not a recognised side-effect of trimethoprim?</p>
            <ul class="options">
                <li class="option" data-correct="true">A. Tendon damage</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. Rash</li>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: A Tendon damage: Tendon damage, including tendonitis and tendon rupture, is a known side effect of fluoroquinolone antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin), not typically associated with trimethoprim. B Rash: Skin rashes, including maculopapular rash and urticaria, are common side effects of trimethoprim. C Worsening hyperkalaemia in patients with renal failure: Trimethoprim can cause hyperkalemia, especially in patients with renal impairment or those taking other medications that increase potassium levels, due to its effect on potassium excretion in the distal tubules (similar to potassium-sparing diuretics). D Folate deficiency: Trimethoprim is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, which can interfere with folic acid metabolism. This can lead to megaloblastic anemia or other signs of folate deficiency, particularly in patients with pre-existing folate depletion or during long-term use. E Stevens-Johnson syndrome: Severe dermatological reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare but serious potential side effects of trimethoprim, often when used in combination with sulfamethoxazole (as co-trimoxazole), but can occur with trimethoprim alone.</p>

            <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">2.</span> Which of the following is not a recognised cause of epididymo-orchitis?</p>
            <ul class="options">
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">A. E-coli</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. Chlamydia trachomatis</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">C. N. gonorrhoeae</li>

                <li class="option" data-correct="true">E. Amlodipine</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: A E-coli: Escherichia coli is a common bacterial cause of epididymo-orchitis, particularly in older men or those with urinary tract abnormalities or recent instrumentation. B Chlamydia trachomatis: Chlamydia trachomatis is a common sexually transmitted infection that is a leading cause of epididymo-orchitis in sexually active men, typically under 35 years old. C N. gonorrhoeae: Neisseria gonorrhoeae is another common sexually transmitted infection causing epididymo-orchitis in sexually active men. D Mycobacterium TB: Tuberculous epididymo-orchitis can occur as a manifestation of genitourinary tuberculosis, though it is less common than bacterial infections. E Amlodipine: Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension and angina. It is not a recognized cause of epididymo-orchitis. One rare side effect linked to some calcium channel blockers is sexual dysfunction or gynecomastia, but not epididymo-orchitis. An exception could be drug-induced epididymitis (e.g., amiodarone), but amlodipine is not typically implicated.</p>

        <div class="question-container" data-question-id="1.3">
            <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">3.</span> Which of the following types of adhesion molecules is associated with pyelonephritis in the general population?</p>
            <ul class="options">
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">A. Type I mannose sensitive</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. Dr adhesin</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">C. Type S pili</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="true">D. Type II mannose resistant</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">E. F adhesin</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) are the most common cause of pyelonephritis. Their virulence factors include adhesins that allow them to bind to uroepithelial cells. A Type I mannose sensitive (FimH): These fimbriae mediate binding to mannosylated glycoproteins on the bladder epithelium and are primarily associated with cystitis (lower UTI). They are sensitive to D-mannose. B Dr adhesin: Dr adhesins bind to Decay Accelerating Factor (DAF) on uroepithelial cells and are associated with both cystitis and pyelonephritis, particularly in pregnant women and children. C Type S pili: S-fimbriae (sfa adhesin) bind to sialyl-galactosides and are associated with neonatal sepsis and meningitis, but can also play a role in ascending UTIs. D Type II mannose resistant: This often refers to P-fimbriae (pap pili), which are mannose-resistant adhesins. P-fimbriae bind to globobiose-containing glycolipids (GbO3, GbO4) on renal epithelial cells and erythrocytes (P blood group antigen). They are strongly associated with pyelonephritis (upper UTI) because they facilitate bacterial ascent and colonization of the kidneys. E F adhesin: F adhesins can refer to various types. For example, F1C fimbriae are also found in UPEC. However, P-fimbriae (a type of mannose-resistant adhesin) are most classically linked to pyelonephritis. Given the options, "Type II mannose resistant" is the best fit as it encompasses P-fimbriae, which are strongly associated with pyelonephritis.</p>

            <ul class="options">
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">A. +300</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. +40</li>

                <li class="option" data-correct="true">D. -50</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Hounsfield Units (HU) are a quantitative scale for describing radiodensity in CT scans. A +300: This range is more typical for calcifications or dense bone. B +40: This range is typical for soft tissues like muscle or solid organs (e.g., liver, kidney parenchyma approx +30 to +60 HU). C 0: Water is defined as 0 HU. D -50: Fat has a negative Hounsfield unit value, typically ranging from -20 to -100 HU, with an average around -50 to -100 HU. Therefore, -50 HU is a typical value for fat.</p>

        <div class="question-container" data-question-id="1.5">
            <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">5.</span> Which of the following detects protein on dipstick urinalysis?</p>
            <ul class="options">
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">A. Peroxidase</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. Red azo dye</li>

                <li class="option" data-correct="false">E. Diazonium salt</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Dipstick urinalysis for protein primarily relies on the "protein error of indicators" principle. A Peroxidase: Peroxidase-like activity is tested for on dipsticks to detect hemoglobin or myoglobin (blood). B Red azo dye: Azo dyes are used in the Griess test for nitrite detection (indirect evidence of bacteriuria). C Indoxyl: Indoxyl esterase is detected by the leukocyte esterase test on dipsticks, indicating the presence of white blood cells. D Tetrabromophenol blue dye: This pH indicator dye is used to detect protein, particularly albumin. At a constant pH (buffered by the reagent pad), certain indicators like tetrabromophenol blue change color in the presence of protein (primarily albumin) due to protein binding to the dye. E Diazonium salt: Diazonium salts are used in the dipstick test for bilirubin.</p>

        <div class="question-container" data-question-id="1.6">
            <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">6.</span> What percentage of patients with unilateral vasal agenesis has upper tract abnormalities?</p>
            <ul class="options">
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">a) 10%</li>

                <li class="option" data-correct="false">e) 95%</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) is well-known, often associated with cystic fibrosis. Congenital unilateral absence of the vas deferens (CUAVD) is less common. Both the vas deferens and the ureteric bud (which gives rise to the kidney, renal pelvis, ureter, and seminal vesicle) originate from the Wolffian (mesonephric) duct. An insult during embryological development affecting the Wolffian duct can lead to abnormalities in structures derived from it. Studies have shown a high association between CUAVD and ipsilateral renal agenesis or other upper urinary tract anomalies. The reported rates of associated renal anomalies in patients with CUAVD vary in literature, but they are significant. While exact percentages can vary slightly between studies, a substantial proportion of men with CUAVD have ipsilateral renal agenesis or other significant renal anomalies. Figures often cited are in the range of 70-80%. Option (d) 80% reflects this high association. For example, some sources state that up to 79% of men with CUAVD have an ipsilateral renal anomaly, most commonly renal agenesis.</p>

        <div class="question-container" data-question-id="1.7">
            <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">7.</span> A patient presents with a paranephritic abscess caused by an infection with Staphylococcus aureus. The treatment of choice consists of:</p>
            <ul class="options">
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">a. A percutaneous puncture of the abscess</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">b. An appropriate treatment with antibiotics</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="true">c. Treatment with antibiotics, incision, drainage</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">d. None of the above</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: A paranephric (or perinephric) abscess is a collection of pus in the space around the kidney. Staphylococcus aureus is a common causative organism, often due to hematogenous spread. a. A percutaneous puncture of the abscess: Percutaneous drainage is indeed a common and often preferred initial method for draining many perinephric abscesses, especially if well-defined and accessible. However, it might not be sufficient for all cases, and it's usually combined with antibiotics. b. An appropriate treatment with antibiotics: Antibiotics are essential but are rarely sufficient alone for an established abscess, as drug penetration into the abscess cavity is poor. c. Treatment with antibiotics, incision, drainage: This is the comprehensive approach. Antibiotics are crucial to treat the systemic infection and prevent spread. Drainage of the pus is necessary for source control and resolution of the abscess. Drainage can be achieved percutaneously (needle aspiration or catheter placement under imaging guidance) or via open surgical incision and drainage if percutaneous methods fail, are not feasible, or if the abscess is very large or complex. The term "incision, drainage" can encompass both percutaneous and open surgical drainage. d. None of the above: This is incorrect as combined antibiotic therapy and drainage is the standard. Comparing 'a' and 'c': 'c' is more comprehensive. While percutaneous puncture is a form of drainage, "incision, drainage" broadly covers the necessary intervention alongside antibiotics. If "incision" strictly means open surgery, then percutaneous drainage + antibiotics would be the first line for many. However, in the context of choices, 'c' best represents the standard principles of abscess management. Small, early abscesses might respond to antibiotics alone, but an established abscess usually requires drainage. Given "abscess", drainage is key.</p>

        <div class="question-container" data-question-id="1.8">
            <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">8.</span> Prenatally detected multicystic dysplastic kidneys:</p>
            <ul class="options">
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">a. Invariably enlarge in post natal life</li>

                <li class="option" data-correct="false">d. Can only be detected ultrasonically in the third trimester of gestation</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is a congenital anomaly where the kidney is replaced by non-communicating cysts and dysplastic tissue; it is non-functional. a. Invariably enlarge in post natal life: While some MCDKs may initially enlarge, the natural history for many is involution (shrinking) and eventual disappearance, not invariable enlargement. b. Have been observed to involute in utero: Yes, MCDKs can begin to involute (decrease in size) even before birth (in utero) or during infancy and childhood. This spontaneous involution is a well-documented part of their natural history. c. Usually give rise to clinical symptoms in the neonatal period: Most infants with unilateral MCDK are asymptomatic, especially if the contralateral kidney is normal and provides adequate renal function. Symptoms are rare unless complications like infection, mass effect, or hypertension occur, which is not "usual." d. Can only be detected ultrasonically in the third trimester of gestation: MCDKs can often be detected by prenatal ultrasound as early as the mid-second trimester (around 18-20 weeks), not just in the third trimester.</p>

        <div class="question-container" data-question-id="1.9">
            <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">9.</span> In a complete duplex system, the position of the ureteric orifice of the upper moiety in relation to the ureteric orifice of the lower moiety is:</p>
            <ul class="options">
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">a. Below and lateral</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">b. Above and lateral</li>

                <li class="option" data-correct="false">d. Above and medial</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: This refers to the Weigert-Meyer rule, which describes the anatomical relationship of the ureteral orifices in a completely duplicated collecting system: The ureter draining the upper pole (upper moiety) of the kidney has a more caudal (inferior/below) and medial insertion into the bladder. This ureter is often associated with ureterocele, ectopic insertion, and obstruction. The ureter draining the lower pole (lower moiety) of the kidney has a more cranial (superior/above) and lateral insertion into the bladder. This ureter often has a shorter intravesical tunnel and is more prone to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Therefore, the upper moiety ureteric orifice is below (caudal/inferior) and medial to the lower moiety ureteric orifice.</p>

        <div class="question-container" data-question-id="1.10">
            <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">10.</span> In endoscopic management of PUJ obstruction the incisions at stricture site must be because of related blood supply:</p>
            <ul class="options">
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">a. Anterior</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="true">b. Posterior</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">c. Lateral</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">d. Medial</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Endoscopic management of ureteropelvic junction (PUJ) obstruction, such as antegrade or retrograde endopyelotomy, involves incising the narrowed segment. The main blood supply to the renal pelvis and proximal ureter, particularly aberrant or crossing vessels that can cause extrinsic PUJ obstruction, most commonly cross anterior to the PUJ. To avoid injuring these vessels, the incision is typically made in a posterolateral direction. a. Anterior: An anterior incision carries a high risk of injuring crossing vessels, which are frequently located anteriorly. b. Posterior: A directly posterior incision is safer than anterior. However, a posterolateral incision is often preferred to ensure a full-thickness cut through the strictured segment away from the typical location of vessels. If strictly choosing from the options, posterior is chosen to avoid anterior vessels. c. Lateral: A purely lateral incision is also considered, and often the incision is posterolateral. d. Medial: Medial incisions are generally avoided due to the proximity of hilar structures and major vessels. The question "must be because of related blood supply" implies the incision site is chosen to avoid major vessels. Since vessels are commonly anterior, a posterior or posterolateral incision is standard. Of the single-direction options, "Posterior" is the safest general direction to avoid the most common vessel location. If vessels are identified in an atypical location (e.g., posterior crossing vessel, which is rare), the incision site would be adjusted accordingly. However, the standard teaching emphasizes avoiding the common anterior vessels.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) effectiveness varies with stone composition, size, and location. a. Calcium Oxalate monohydrate (COM): These stones (whewellite) are known to be the hardest and densest type of calcium stones, making them relatively resistant to fragmentation by ESWL. They often require more shocks or higher energy levels, and may have lower success rates compared to other stone types. b. Struvite stone: Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) stones, also known as infection stones, are generally moderately hard but can be fragmented by ESWL, although large ones may require multiple sessions or alternative treatments due to their size and association with infection. c. Uric acid stone: Uric acid stones are typically less dense than calcium oxalate monohydrate stones and are generally quite fragile, responding well to ESWL. They are also amenable to medical dissolution therapy (alkalinization of urine). d. Xanthine stone: Xanthine stones are rare, radiolucent stones. They are reported to be relatively hard and may be resistant to ESWL, similar to or even harder than some calcium oxalate stones. However, Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate is more common and classically cited as the hardest for ESWL among common stone types. Some literature suggests brushite (calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate) and cysteine stones are also very hard. Between COM and Xanthine, COM is more frequently encountered and widely recognized for its hardness. If both were options and data strongly pointed to Xanthine being harder, that would be chosen. However, COM is a very strong candidate for "hardest." Considering the common stone types, Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate is the generally accepted answer for being the hardest to fragment with ESWL.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) causes lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). a. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs): Drugs like finasteride and dutasteride reduce prostate size by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. They are effective, especially for larger prostates, and can reduce the risk of acute urinary retention and need for surgery. However, their onset of action is slow (months). b. Phytotherapy: Plant extracts (e.g., saw palmetto) are used by some patients, but their efficacy is not consistently supported by high-quality evidence compared to established pharmacological treatments. They are not considered main medical treatment by most guidelines. c. Alpha blockers (α1-adrenergic antagonists): Drugs like tamsulosin, alfuzosin, silodosin, and doxazosin relax smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urinary flow and LUTS. They have a rapid onset of action (days to weeks) and are generally considered first-line medical therapy for symptomatic BPH. d. Beta blockers: Beta blockers are used for conditions like hypertension and heart disease; they are not a treatment for BPH. In fact, some beta blockers could potentially worsen voiding symptoms in certain situations, although this is not their primary concern in BPH. Alpha blockers are typically the initial and main medical treatment for rapid symptom relief in BPH. 5-ARIs are also a mainstay, particularly for larger prostates or for long-term disease modification, often used in combination with alpha blockers. However, for "main" or initial symptomatic relief, alpha blockers are paramount.</p>

                <li class="option" data-correct="false">d) VUR should never be managed by ureteric reimplantation</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: This relates to the Weigert-Meyer rule in complete ureteral duplication. a. VUR typically affects the lower pole ureter in cases of complete duplication: Correct. The lower pole ureter inserts more cranially (superiorly) and laterally into the bladder. This often results in a shorter intravesical submucosal tunnel, making it less competent and more prone to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). b. VUR typically affects the upper pole ureter in cases of complete duplication: Incorrect. The upper pole ureter inserts more caudally (inferiorly) and medially. It is more commonly associated with obstruction, often due to a ureterocele or an ectopic insertion, rather than VUR (though VUR into an ectopic ureter can occur). c. VUR in duplex systems is more likely to resolve spontaneously than VUR in single systems: The likelihood of spontaneous resolution of VUR depends on factors like grade, patient age, and bladder bowel dysfunction, rather than solely on whether it's a duplex or single system. There isn't strong evidence to suggest it's more likely to resolve in duplex systems. Resolution rates are generally similar based on grade. d) VUR should never be managed by ureteric reimplantation: Incorrect. Ureteric reimplantation (ureteroneocystostomy) is a standard surgical treatment for VUR, including in duplex systems, when indicated (e.g., high-grade reflux, breakthrough infections, renal scarring). Reimplantation in duplex systems can be more complex (e.g., common sheath reimplantation or individual reimplantation).</p>

            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are predominantly caused by bacteria. a. Proteus mirabilis: A common cause of UTI, especially in patients with urinary stones (it produces urease, leading to alkaline urine and struvite stones) or indwelling catheters. It accounts for a smaller percentage of uncomplicated UTIs than E. coli. b. Klebsiella spp.: Another Gram-negative bacterium that can cause UTIs, often in more complicated cases, hospitalized patients, or those with catheters. c. E.coli (Escherichia coli): This is by far the most common pathogen causing UTIs, responsible for 75-95% of acute uncomplicated cystitis cases and a majority of complicated UTIs as well. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strains have specific virulence factors that facilitate urinary tract colonization. d. Serratia spp.: Less common, typically associated with hospital-acquired or catheter-associated UTIs. e. Pseudomonas spp. (specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa): Often associated with hospital-acquired infections, catheter use, or immunocompromised individuals. It can be more resistant to antibiotics. Therefore, E. coli is undisputedly the main pathogen causing UTIs in most populations.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: The evaluation of hematuria aims to identify the source and cause, which can range from benign conditions to malignancy. a. IVP (Intravenous Pyelogram): Largely replaced by CT urography. It can show collecting system anatomy and some pathologies but has lower sensitivity for small renal masses and other causes compared to CT. b. CT (Computed Tomography): Specifically, CT Urography (CTU) is considered the modality of choice for evaluating the upper urinary tract (kidneys and ureters) in patients with hematuria, especially those at risk for malignancy. CTU typically includes non-contrast, arterial, nephrographic, and delayed (excretory) phases, providing detailed anatomical and functional information. It is excellent for detecting renal masses, stones, urothelial tumors, and other causes. c. Angiography: Invasive and used for specific indications like suspected vascular malformations (e.g., AVMs), renal artery stenosis, or for embolization in cases of intractable bleeding, not as a primary diagnostic tool for all hematuria. d. Retrograde ureteroscopy: An invasive endoscopic procedure used to directly visualize the ureter and renal pelvis. It is often used for diagnosis (e.g., biopsy) or treatment if a lesion is suspected or identified by other imaging, or if upper tract cytology is positive with negative CTU/cystoscopy. Not a first-line modality for initial suspicion. e. Ultrasound: Often used as an initial, non-invasive screening tool, especially for kidney evaluation (e.g., cysts, hydronephrosis, large masses). However, it has limitations in visualizing the entire ureter and is less sensitive than CT for small renal masses or urothelial tumors. It's a good first step in some algorithms but CTU is more definitive for comprehensive evaluation. For "modality of choice in suspected renal haematuria" implying a thorough investigation for potentially serious causes, CT Urography is generally preferred.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Ureteroceles are cystic dilatations of the terminal, intravesical segment of the ureter. Based on Stephens' classification, "Stenotic," "Sphincteric," and "Cecoureterocele" (and sphincterostenotic) are types. "Orthotopic" is a location descriptor (meaning in the normal place) rather than a type within this specific common classification system. So, "Orthotopic" might be considered "not a standard type" in that list when compared to specific morphological classifications like Sphincteric or Cecoureterocele. While "orthotopic ureterocele" (or intravesical ureterocele) is a standard concept, the term "Orthotopic" by itself as a type can be considered less specific or a broader category descriptor compared to the others in some classification contexts, particularly when Stephens' classification is considered standard, where it's not explicitly listed as a primary type like the others.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Varicoceles are associated with the "stress pattern" in semen analysis, which typically includes: Decreased sperm motility (asthenozoospermia): This is often considered one of the earliest and most consistently affected parameters. Poor sperm morphology (teratozoospermia): Increased numbers of abnormal sperm forms, particularly tapered heads. Low sperm count/concentration (oligozoospermia): Though not always present or as severely affected as motility and morphology. While all these parameters can be affected, sperm motility is very frequently and significantly impaired by varicoceles due to factors like increased scrotal temperature, oxidative stress, and reflux of toxic metabolites. Studies often highlight asthenozoospermia as a key finding. Sperm count / Sperm concentration can be affected, leading to oligozoospermia, but motility and morphology changes are often more prominent or occur earlier. Strict morphology is also commonly affected (teratozoospermia). The "most affected" can be debated, but impaired motility is a hallmark. Some studies suggest motility is the most sensitive indicator of varicocele-induced testicular dysfunction.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: The presentation of recurrent epididymal pain, tenderness, induration ("hard"), fever, and rigors in a 15-year-old suggests an infectious or inflammatory process of the epididymis. a. Pyelonephritis: This is a kidney infection, which can cause flank pain, fever, and rigors, but typically not primary epididymal induration and tenderness as described. b. TB (Tuberculous epididymitis): Genitourinary tuberculosis can manifest as chronic or recurrent epididymitis. It often presents with a hard, non-tender or mildly tender, nodular epididymis ("beaded" vas deferens may also be present). Constitutional symptoms like fever can occur. In endemic areas or high-risk individuals, TB should be considered for chronic or recurrent epididymitis, especially with induration. The "hard" description is suggestive. c. Epididymal tumor: While possible, epididymal tumors are rare, especially in a 15-year-old. They usually present as a painless mass, though pain can occur. Recurrent fever and rigors are less typical for a primary tumor unless there's secondary infection or torsion (of an appendix epididymis, for example, but the description is of the epididymis itself). d. Ectopic ureter: An ectopic ureter draining into the seminal vesicle or vas deferens could cause recurrent epididymitis. This is a possibility, especially in a younger patient with recurrent symptoms. However, the prominent "hard" induration along with systemic symptoms (fever, rigors) makes an active infection like TB a strong consideration. Between TB and an underlying anomaly like an ectopic ureter causing recurrent bacterial epididymitis, TB is well-known for causing a hard, indurated epididymis. Acute bacterial epididymitis (often sexually transmitted in older adolescents, or E. coli related to urinary issues) would be tender and swollen, but "recurrent" and "hard" leans more towards chronic inflammation like TB or sequelae of recurrent infections. Given the options, TB provides a good fit for the "hard, indurated" epididymis and recurrent febrile episodes.</p>

            <p class="explanation">Explanation: In renal transplantation, the donor renal artery is anastomosed to a recipient artery. While end-to-end anastomosis with the internal iliac artery is a classic technique, end-to-side anastomosis to the external iliac artery is very common and often preferred in current practice due to its accessibility and adequate caliber. The question's "end to end usually" phrasing can be ambiguous. However, the external iliac artery is the most frequently used recipient vessel for arterial anastomosis in renal transplantation overall. If "usually" refers to the most common recipient artery involved, the external iliac artery is a strong candidate. Both internal and external iliac arteries are used, with techniques including end-to-end (classically with internal iliac) or end-to-side (commonly with external iliac). Given its prominence in modern transplant surgery, the external iliac artery is chosen here, acknowledging the potential ambiguity of "end-to-end usually."</p>

            <p class="explanation">Explanation: a) This is tricky. Infantile hemangiomas are benign tumors of endothelial cells, distinct from vascular malformations (structural anomalies). However, in looser terminology, "hemangioma" might broadly imply a vessel-related anomaly. Given other options are clearly false for infantile hemangiomas (most common type), (a) might be the intended best fit despite strict classification. Many infantile hemangiomas appear after birth, can occur anywhere, often involute without surgery, and are not pigmented premalignant lesions.</p>

            <p class="explanation">Correct answer: E<br>a. ESWL can be an option for ureteral stones, but for a 1.1 cm stone in the distal ureter in a child, ureteroscopy often has higher success rates.<br>b. Conservative management has failed for two weeks with persistent dilatation; further prolonged conservative management for a 1.1 cm stone is not optimal.<br>c. Open ureterolithotomy is too invasive as a first-line intervention when less invasive options are available.<br>d. Basket extraction alone for a 1.1 cm stone may be difficult or traumatic without prior fragmentation.<br>e.

Escharotomy is for circumferential burns causing constriction; fasciotomy is for deep compartment pressure. Electrical injury can cause deep burns requiring escharotomy, but the described signs strongly point to compartment syndrome.<br>c. Early excision and grafting is for burn wound management, not the emergent treatment of pulselessness and edema suggesting compartment syndrome.<br>d.
