        <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">1.</span> Which of the following is a positive symptom of schizophrenia?</p>
        <ul class="options">
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">A. Hallucination</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. Delusion</li>

            <li class="option" data-correct="false">E. Anhedonia</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. Hallucination: Correct. Hallucinations (e.g., auditory, visual) are perceptions experienced without external stimuli and are considered positive symptoms of schizophrenia.<br>
            b. Delusion: Correct. Delusions are fixed, false beliefs that are not amenable to change in light of conflicting evidence and are considered positive symptoms of schizophrenia.<br>
            c. A&b: Correct. Since both hallucinations (A) and delusions (B) are positive symptoms of schizophrenia, this option is the most comprehensive correct answer.<br>
            d. Social isolation: Incorrect. Social isolation is typically considered a negative symptom of schizophrenia, reflecting diminished social drive or engagement.<br>
            e. Anhedonia: Incorrect. Anhedonia, the inability to experience pleasure, is a negative symptom of schizophrenia.<br>

    <div class="question-container" data-question-id="q2">
        <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">2.</span> The primary treatment for schizophrenia involves:</p>
        <ul class="options">
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">A. Antidepressants</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="true">B. Antipsychotic medications</li>

            <li class="option" data-correct="false">E. Anticonvulsants</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. Antidepressants: Incorrect. Antidepressants may be used adjunctively for comorbid depression in schizophrenia but are not the primary treatment for psychosis.<br>
            b. Antipsychotic medications: Correct. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone and primary pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia, targeting positive symptoms and helping prevent relapse.<br>
            c. Benzodiazepines: Incorrect. Benzodiazepines may be used for agitation or anxiety in schizophrenia but are not the primary treatment.<br>
            d. Stimulants: Incorrect. Stimulants are generally contraindicated or used with extreme caution in schizophrenia as they can exacerbate psychosis.<br>
            e. Anticonvulsants: Incorrect. Some anticonvulsants are used as mood stabilizers or for aggression, but they are not the primary treatment for the core symptoms of schizophrenia.<br>

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. 2 years: Incorrect. While maintenance treatment can last for years for recurrent or chronic depression, for a first episode, continuation treatment is typically shorter.<br>
            b. 09-12 months: Correct. After achieving remission from a first major depressive episode, continuation pharmacotherapy is typically recommended for 6-12 months (or 4-9 months depending on guidelines) to prevent relapse. 9-12 months falls within this common recommendation.<br>

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. Social deficit: Correct. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts are core, defining features of Autism Spectrum Disorder.<br>
            b. Low IQ: Incorrect. While intellectual disability can co-occur with ASD, it is not a universal or hallmark feature; individuals with ASD can have any level of intellectual ability.<br>
            c. Lack of interest in physical appearance: Incorrect. This is not a specific or hallmark feature of ASD.<br>
            d. Obsessive-compulsive traits: Incorrect. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities are a core feature of ASD, which can include obsessive-like behaviors, but "social deficit" is more encompassing of the primary diagnostic area.<br>

            b. Low mood: Correct. Depressed mood (low mood) most of the day, nearly every day, is one of the two cardinal symptoms required for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The other is anhedonia.<br>
            c. Increased energy: Incorrect. Decreased energy or fatigue is typical of depression.<br>
            d. Delusions and hallucinations: Incorrect. While psychotic features like delusions and hallucinations can occur in severe major depressive disorder, they are not considered the most fundamental core symptom like low mood or anhedonia.<br>
            e. All of the above: Incorrect.<br>

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Incorrect. GAD involves excessive worry about multiple topics, not primarily focused on social situations.<br>
            b. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia): Correct. The patient's symptoms – intense fear of social situations (especially performance situations like speaking in groups), fear of being judged or embarrassed, avoidance of social gatherings, and chronicity – are classic features of Social Anxiety Disorder.<br>
            c. Panic Disorder: Incorrect. Panic disorder involves recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and worry about future attacks, which is not the primary description here.<br>
            d. Obsessive compulsive disorder: Incorrect. OCD involves obsessions and compulsions, which are not described.<br>

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. Bipolar disorder: Incorrect. While this could be a depressive episode within bipolar disorder, there's no information about past manic or hypomanic episodes. Based purely on the current symptoms, MDD is most direct.<br>
            b. Major depressive episode: Correct. The constellation of symptoms (low mood, anhedonia, fatigue, poor concentration, early morning awakening, weight loss, feelings of worthlessness) for 2 months meets criteria for a major depressive episode.<br>
            c. Generalized anxiety disorder: Incorrect. The primary symptoms are depressive, not anxiety-focused, although worry can co-occur.<br>
            d. Adjustment disorder: Incorrect. Adjustment disorder involves distress following a stressor that is out of proportion, but the symptom cluster here is robust enough for MDD.<br>

            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. Anxiety: Incorrect. While often comorbid, anxiety is not a cardinal symptom required for the diagnosis of MDD.<br>
            b. Psychomotor agitation: Incorrect. Psychomotor agitation or retardation is a symptom, but not one of the two essential core symptoms.<br>
            c. Depressed mood or loss of interest (anhedonia): Correct. To diagnose a major depressive episode, at least one of these two symptoms (depressed mood or anhedonia) must be present nearly every day for at least two weeks.<br>

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. Generalized anxiety disorder: Incorrect. GAD is characterized by chronic, pervasive worry, not discrete, intense episodes like these.<br>
            b. Panic disorder: Correct. The description is classic for recurrent panic attacks: sudden onset of intense fear accompanied by physical symptoms (palpitations, chest tightness, dizziness) and cognitive symptoms (fear of dying), with episodes being time-limited. Multiple occurrences suggest Panic Disorder if accompanied by worry about future attacks or maladaptive changes in behavior.<br>
            c. Cardiac arrhythmia: Incorrect. While symptoms can mimic cardiac issues, the normal ECG and physical exam make this less likely as the primary psychiatric diagnosis, though cardiac causes should always be ruled out initially.<br>
            d. Social phobia: Incorrect. Social phobia involves fear of social situations and scrutiny, not typically spontaneous attacks like these.<br>

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. Mania: Incorrect. While mania can have psychotic features, the chronicity (9 months) and specific symptom cluster (paranoia, auditory hallucinations, disorganized speech, delusions of control) are more characteristic of schizophrenia.<br>
            b. Schizophrenia: Correct. The presence of delusions (paranoia, thought control), hallucinations (auditory), disorganized speech, and a duration of 9 months (well over the 6-month criterion for schizophrenia) with significant dysfunction (implied) points to schizophrenia.<br>
            c. Delusional disorder: Incorrect. Delusional disorder involves delusions but typically not prominent hallucinations or disorganized speech, and overall functioning apart from the delusion's impact is not as impaired as in schizophrenia.<br>
            d. Brief psychotic disorder: Incorrect. Brief psychotic disorder lasts from 1 day to 1 month.<br>
            e. Major depressive episode: Incorrect. While MDE can have psychotic features, the primary symptoms described are psychotic, not mood-related.<br>

            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. Bulimia nervosa: Incorrect. Individuals with bulimia nervosa are typically normal weight or overweight and engage in binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors. Low BMI is more characteristic of anorexia.<br>
            b. Anorexia nervosa: Correct. The combination of low BMI, intense fear of gaining weight, excessive exercise (a behavior to prevent weight gain), and denial of the seriousness of being underweight are hallmark features of Anorexia Nervosa.<br>
            c. Binge eating disorder: Incorrect. Binge eating disorder involves binge eating without compensatory behaviors and is often associated with being overweight or obese.<br>
            d. Body dysmorphic disorder: Incorrect. BDD involves preoccupation with perceived flaws in appearance, not necessarily low BMI or the specific drive for thinness seen in AN.<br>

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. language disorder: Incorrect. While language issues can be present, the broader social deficits (poor eye contact, not responding to name) and restricted behaviors (fixation on lining up toys, atypical play) point beyond a primary language disorder.<br>
            b. Autism spectrum disorder: Correct. The triad of deficits in social communication/interaction (poor eye contact, not responding to name, not playing with others) and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (fixation on lining up toys) are characteristic of ASD.<br>
            c. ADHD: Incorrect. While some features might overlap (e.g., not responding if inattentive), the core social deficits and restricted behaviors are more indicative of ASD.<br>
            d. Selective mutism: Incorrect. Selective mutism involves failure to speak in specific social situations despite speaking in others, not the broader pattern described.<br>

            a. Bipolar I disorder: Correct. The presence of at least one manic episode (1 week of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, impulsivity, likely causing significant impairment or meeting criteria for mania) is sufficient for a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder. The history of depressive episodes is common but not required if a manic episode is established.<br>

            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. Generalized anxiety disorder: Correct. The key features are excessive worry about multiple life events, occurring for more than 6 months, accompanied by associated symptoms like muscle tension, restlessness, and sleep difficulty. This is classic GAD.<br>
            b. Panic disorder: Incorrect. No panic attacks are described.<br>
            c. Social anxiety disorder: Incorrect. The worry is about multiple life events, not specifically social scrutiny.<br>
            d. OCD: Incorrect. No obsessions or compulsions are described.<br>

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Incorrect. The anxiety is clearly linked to a specific traumatic event.<br>
            b. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: Correct. The child experienced a traumatic event (car accident). Symptoms include re-experiencing (nightmares), avoidance (avoids car rides), hyperarousal (anxious with loud noises), and negative alterations in mood/cognition (school decline, stomachaches as somatic complaints). The duration is 2 months (more than 1 month), fitting PTSD.<br>
            c. Adjustment Disorder: Incorrect. While an adjustment disorder involves distress following a stressor, PTSD criteria seem to be met here, and PTSD takes precedence if its criteria are fulfilled after a Criterion A trauma.<br>
            d. Acute Stress Disorder: Incorrect. Acute Stress Disorder symptoms last from 3 days to 1 month after the trauma. These symptoms have persisted for 2 months.<br>
            e. Panic Disorder: Incorrect. The anxiety is trauma-related, not characterized by unexpected panic attacks.<br>

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. intellectual disability: Correct. The presentation suggests deficits in intellectual functioning (difficulty with problem-solving) and adaptive functioning in conceptual (implied if problem-solving affects learning), social (poor social skills), and practical domains (struggles with daily activities like dressing). This is consistent with Intellectual Disability.<br>
            b. ADHD: Incorrect. While ADHD can affect functioning, the core description points more towards global deficits in intellectual and adaptive skills.<br>
            c. selective mutism: Incorrect. This disorder is about failure to speak in specific situations.<br>
            d. Autism spectrum disorder: Incorrect. While ASD involves social skill deficits and can have co-occurring intellectual disability, the primary description here fits ID more broadly without specific ASD features like restricted/repetitive behaviors being highlighted as core.<br>

            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. Suicidal attempt: Incorrect. A suicidal attempt typically implies intent to die, which she denies.<br>
            b. Impulsive aggression: Incorrect. The act is self-directed harm, not aggression towards others.<br>
            c. Parasuicide / deliberate self harm: Correct. This term describes acts of self-harm without lethal intent, often undertaken to cope with intense emotional distress, communicate distress, or influence others. Her denial of intent to die, expression of regret, and request for help are consistent with this.<br>

            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. Anorexia nervosa: Incorrect. Individuals with anorexia nervosa are underweight. This patient is of normal weight.<br>

            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. Cognitive-behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention: Correct. The boy has clear symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (obsessions about contamination, compulsions of handwashing). Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), specifically Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), is a first-line, evidence-based treatment for OCD in children and adults.<br>
            b. Antipsychotic medication: Incorrect. Not first-line for OCD, though may be used as augmentation in severe, refractory cases.<br>
            c. Psychoanalysis: Incorrect. Not considered a first-line or evidence-based treatment for OCD.<br>
            d. Supportive therapy only: Incorrect. While supportive, it's generally insufficient for OCD.<br>

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. Obsessive-compulsive disorder: Correct. The patient experiences recurrent intrusive thoughts (obsessions about harming her child) that cause distress, and she performs repetitive rituals (compulsions – counting) to neutralize these thoughts. This is characteristic of OCD. The thoughts are egodystonic (unwanted and distressing).<br>
            b. Generalized anxiety disorder: Incorrect. GAD involves pervasive worry, not specific obsessions and compulsions.<br>
            c. Schizophrenia: Incorrect. While thoughts of harm can occur, the pattern of intrusive thoughts neutralized by rituals is OCD, not typically schizophrenia unless other psychotic symptoms are prominent.<br>
            d. Postpartum psychosis: Incorrect. While the content involves her child, this is described as intrusive thoughts with rituals, fitting OCD. Postpartum psychosis would involve more global psychotic symptoms like delusions or hallucinations related to the child, and often a more acute onset and disorganization.<br>
            e. Major depressive disorder: Incorrect. While intrusive thoughts can occur in depression, the specific pattern of obsessions and compulsions points to OCD.<br>
