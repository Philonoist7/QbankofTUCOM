    <div class="question-container" data-question-id="q21">
        <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">Q21.</span> Regarding to pharynx , all true except :</p>
        <ul class="options">
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">A. Include Nasopharynx, oropharynx, Hypopharynx</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. Differ tissue from region to region</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="true">C. Start from base of skull to level of 5th cervical vertebrae</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">D. Palatine tonsil is point of oropharynx</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. (True) The pharynx is anatomically divided into three parts: the nasopharynx (superior, posterior to the nasal cavity), the oropharynx (middle, posterior to the oral cavity), and the hypopharynx or laryngopharynx (inferior, posterior to the larynx).<br>
            b. (True) The epithelial lining of the pharynx varies by region. The nasopharynx is predominantly lined by respiratory epithelium (pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium), while the oropharynx and hypopharynx, which are also part of the digestive tract and subject to abrasion from food, are lined by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.<br>
            c. (False) The pharynx extends from the base of the skull (basiocciput and basisphenoid) superiorly down to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage, which corresponds to the level of the C6 (sixth) cervical vertebra, where it becomes continuous with the esophagus. Therefore, stating it extends to the level of the 5th cervical vertebra is incorrect. This is the "except" statement.<br>
            d. (True) The palatine tonsils are prominent lymphoid tissues located in the lateral walls of the oropharynx, specifically within the tonsillar fossa between the palatoglossal arch anteriorly and the palatopharyngeal arch posteriorly. They are a key feature of the oropharynx.

    <div class="question-container" data-question-id="q6">
        <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">6.</span> Relations of palatine tonsil all true except:</p>
        <ul class="options">
            <li class="option" data-correct="true">A. Anteriorly palatopharyngeal arch</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. Superiorly soft palate</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">C. Inferiorly posterior one third of the tongue</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">D. Medially cavity of oropharynx</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">E. Laterally superior constrictor muscle of the pharynx</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. (False) The palatine tonsil is located in the tonsillar fossa. Anterior to the tonsil is the palatoglossal arch (anterior pillar of the fauces), which contains the palatoglossus muscle. The palatopharyngeal arch (posterior pillar of the fauces), containing the palatopharyngeus muscle, is located posteriorly to the tonsil. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.<br>
            b. (True) The soft palate forms the superior boundary of the tonsillar fossa and thus is superior to the palatine tonsil.<br>
            c. (True) The posterior one-third of the tongue (base of the tongue) lies inferior to the palatine tonsil.<br>
            d. (True) The medial surface of the palatine tonsil is free and faces the cavity of the oropharynx.<br>
            e. (True) The lateral aspect of the palatine tonsil, forming its bed, is related to the superior constrictor muscle of the pharynx, as well as the pharyngobasilar fascia.

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. (Incorrect) The thyroarytenoid muscle is an intrinsic muscle of the larynx supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN).<br>
            b. (Incorrect) The lateral cricoarytenoid muscle is an intrinsic muscle of the larynx supplied by the RLN.<br>
            c. (Correct) The cricothyroid muscle is the only intrinsic laryngeal muscle not supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. It is supplied by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve.<br>
            d. (Incorrect) The posterior cricoarytenoid muscle is an intrinsic muscle of the larynx supplied by the RLN.<br>
            e. (Incorrect) The interarytenoid muscle (comprising transverse and oblique arytenoids) is an intrinsic muscle of the larynx supplied by the RLN.

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. (Incorrect) The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is primarily motor, supplying the cricothyroid muscle.<br>
            b. (Incorrect) The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve provides sensory innervation to the larynx above the vocal cords (supraglottic region).<br>
            c. (Correct) The recurrent laryngeal nerve provides sensory innervation to the larynx below the vocal cords (subglottic region and trachea) and motor innervation to all intrinsic laryngeal muscles except the cricothyroid.<br>
            d. (Incorrect) "Inferior pharyngeal" is not a standard term for the specific sensory supply to the subglottic larynx. Pharyngeal sensation is largely via the pharyngeal plexus (glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves).<br>
            e. (Incorrect) Option c is correct.

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: D<br>
            a. (Incorrect) The epiglottis, part of the supraglottic larynx, has a rich lymphatic drainage.<br>
            b. (Incorrect) The supraglottic region generally has abundant lymphatic drainage.<br>
            c. (Incorrect) The false vocal cords (vestibular folds) are part of the supraglottic region and have rich lymphatic drainage.<br>
            d. (Correct) The true vocal cords have very sparse or practically absent lymphatic drainage. This anatomical feature is significant in the behavior and spread of glottic cancers.<br>
            e. (Incorrect) The subglottic region has lymphatic drainage, which differs from the supraglottic drainage but is present.

        <ul class="options">
            <li class="option" data-correct="true">A. Vallecula</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. (Correct) The valleculae are depressions located between the base of the tongue and the anterior aspect of the epiglottis. They are anatomically part of the oropharynx, not the larynx itself, although they are in close proximity to the supraglottic larynx.<br>
            b. (Incorrect) The aryepiglottic folds are key structures forming the lateral boundaries of the supraglottic larynx.<br>
            c. (Incorrect) The false vocal cords (vestibular folds) are located within the supraglottic larynx, superior to the true vocal cords.<br>
            d. (Incorrect) The laryngeal ventricle (sinus of Morgagni) is the space between the false vocal cords (superiorly, part of supraglottis) and the true vocal cords (inferiorly, part of glottis). The supraglottis extends down to the ventricle, so the ventricle is intimately related to and often considered at the boundary or within the broader concept of supraglottic structures depending on precise definition, but the vallecula is definitively outside the larynx.

    <div class="question-container" data-question-id="q55">
        <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">Q55.</span> The functions of the larynx are :</p>
        <ul class="options">
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">A. Protection of lower airway</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. Phonation and speech</li>

            <li class="option" data-correct="true">E. All of the above</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: E<br>
            a. (Correct) The larynx plays a crucial role in protecting the lower airway from aspiration through mechanisms like epiglottic closure and vocal cord adduction during swallowing.<br>
            b. (Correct) Phonation, the production of sound for speech, is a primary function of the larynx, achieved by the vibration of the vocal cords.<br>
            c. (Correct) Fixation of the chest (thoracic fixation) is achieved by closing the glottis (Valsalva maneuver), which increases intrathoracic pressure and stabilizes the thorax for effortful activities like lifting, coughing, or defecation.<br>
            d. (Correct) The larynx, by maintaining a patent airway during respiration, allows for normal breathing mechanics. During inspiration, the decrease in intrathoracic pressure (thoracic pump mechanism) helps promote venous return to the heart. While actions like Valsalva (involving laryngeal closure for chest fixation) impede venous return, the larynx's role in normal breathing supports this function.<br>
            e. (Correct) Since A, B, C, and D are all considered functions of the larynx (with D being understood in the context of its role in normal respiration), this option is the most appropriate.

    <!-- Questions -->
    <div class="question-container" data-question-id="q18">
        <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">Q18.</span> Regarding laryngeal trauma, incorrect statement</p>
        <ul class="options">
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">A. It is rare</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. Adults have calcified cartilage prone to fracture</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="true">C. Usually isolated</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">D. May present with dysphonia and distress</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">E. Penetrating injuries have worse prognosis</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. Correct statement. Laryngeal trauma is relatively uncommon, representing less than 1% of all blunt trauma admissions.<br>
            b. Correct statement. In adults, laryngeal cartilages (especially the thyroid and cricoid) undergo progressive ossification with age, making them more brittle and susceptible to fracture upon impact compared to the more pliable cartilage in children.<br>
            c. Incorrect statement. Laryngeal trauma, particularly when significant, is often associated with other injuries to the head, neck, chest, or multisystem trauma, especially in high-energy impacts (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, assaults). It is not usually an isolated injury.<br>
            d. Correct statement. Common signs and symptoms of laryngeal trauma include dysphonia (hoarseness or voice change), odynophonia (painful speech), dyspnea (difficulty breathing), stridor, neck pain, tenderness, ecchymosis, subcutaneous emphysema, and hemoptysis. Respiratory distress can be a prominent feature.<br>
            e. Correct statement. Penetrating laryngeal injuries can directly sever vital structures, involve major blood vessels, the esophagus, or the spinal cord, and often carry a higher risk of immediate life-threatening complications and potentially worse overall prognosis compared to many blunt injuries, although both types can be severe.

        <ul class="options">
            <li class="option" data-correct="true">A. Always you should examine the wound by probing</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. May associate with esophageal trauma</li>

            <li class="option" data-correct="false">D. Has high morbidity and fatality in comparison with blunt trauma</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">E. Sometime associated with surgical emphysema</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. Incorrect statement. Blind probing of penetrating neck wounds in an emergency setting or outside of a controlled surgical environment is contraindicated. It can dislodge clots leading to catastrophic hemorrhage, convert a contained injury into an uncontained one, or introduce infection. Wound exploration should be done under direct vision in an operating room.<br>
            b. Correct statement. The larynx and esophagus are in close anatomical proximity in the neck. A penetrating injury to the larynx has a significant chance of also injuring the esophagus.<br>
            c. Correct statement. The neck contains major vascular structures, including the carotid arteries and jugular veins. Penetrating injuries can easily damage these vessels, leading to severe, life-threatening hemorrhage.<br>
            d. Correct statement. Penetrating laryngeal injuries, due to the high likelihood of associated vascular, airway, and esophageal injuries, often have high morbidity (complications) and fatality rates. While severe blunt trauma can also be devastating, penetrating injuries often involve direct violation of critical structures.<br>
            e. Correct statement. If a penetrating injury breaches the larynx or trachea (air-containing structures), air can escape into the surrounding soft tissues, leading to subcutaneous or surgical emphysema.

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: E<br>
            a. Can lead to. If the air-filled larynx or trachea is breached by a penetrating injury, air can leak into the surrounding subcutaneous tissues, causing surgical emphysema.<br>
            b. Can lead to. Injury to the larynx or trachea can cause bleeding into the airway, which may be coughed up as hemoptysis.<br>
            c. Can lead to. Bleeding from injured tissues or vessels in or around the larynx can lead to hematoma formation. A significant hematoma can compress and obstruct the airway.<br>
            d. Can lead to. The esophagus lies posterior to the larynx and trachea, making it vulnerable to associated injury in cases of penetrating neck trauma.<br>
            e. Cannot lead to (this is the "except"). Penetrating injuries to the larynx are serious and potentially life-threatening. They can result in significant morbidity, including permanent voice changes, chronic airway problems (e.g., stenosis), and complications from associated injuries. Therefore, a "good prognosis" is not an expected outcome without significant and appropriate medical and surgical intervention; even then, complications can arise.

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: E<br>
            a. (Incorrect) Lymphomas of the oropharynx most commonly arise from the lymphoid tissue of Waldeyer's ring, particularly the palatine tonsils (located on the lateral walls) and the lingual tonsils (at the base of the tongue, forming part of the anterior/inferior wall). While lymphoma can occur in the superior wall (soft palate), it is not considered as common as in the tonsillar regions.<br>
            b. (Incorrect) Clinical examination is essential for initial suspicion, identifying a mass, and guiding further investigations. However, the definitive diagnosis of lymphoma ("best diagnostic") is made by histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen, often with immunohistochemistry and molecular studies.<br>
            c. (Incorrect) Lymphomas can occur in both males and females. There is no basis for the statement that it never occurs in females.<br>
            d. (Incorrect) The lateral walls of the oropharynx, where the palatine tonsils are located, are a very common site for lymphomas. Stating it "never" occurs there is definitively false.<br>
            e. (Correct) Since options A, B, C, and D are all incorrect or significantly misleading, "Non of the above" is the correct answer. Oropharyngeal lymphomas are common in the lateral walls (tonsils) and base of tongue, are diagnosed definitively by biopsy, and occur in both sexes.

            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. Correct. The "thumb sign" or "thumbprint sign" on a lateral neck X-ray is the classic radiological finding for acute epiglottitis, representing the swollen, edematous epiglottis.<br>
            b. Incorrect. Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is associated with the "steeple sign" on an anteroposterior (AP) neck X-ray due to subglottic narrowing.<br>
            c. Incorrect. Quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) typically does not show a thumb sign; diagnosis is often clinical or aided by ultrasound/CT showing a peritonsillar collection.<br>
            d. Incorrect. Retropharyngeal abscess may show widening of the prevertebral soft tissues on a lateral neck X-ray, but not a thumb sign.

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: E<br>
            a. Correct. Acute laryngitis is most commonly caused by viral infections. Voice overuse or strain can also precipitate or exacerbate it.<br>
            b. Correct. Hoarseness is the hallmark symptom of laryngitis and can range from mild huskiness to complete aphonia (loss of voice).<br>
            c. Correct. Supportive measures such as adequate fluid intake (hydration) and humidification of inspired air are important components of treatment for acute laryngitis.<br>
            d. Correct. A dry, irritating cough often accompanies acute laryngitis, and cough suppressants (sedatives) can provide symptomatic relief.<br>

            Correct answer: E<br>
            a. Incorrect. Acute epiglottitis is characterized by the "thumb sign" on a lateral neck X-ray.<br>
            b. Incorrect. Acute pharyngitis typically does not have a specific pathognomonic X-ray sign like the steeple sign; diagnosis is primarily clinical.<br>
            c. Incorrect. Acute laryngitis involves inflammation of the larynx; while X-rays are not routinely done, it does not typically cause the steeple sign.<br>
            d. Incorrect. Chronic laryngitis is a persistent inflammation and does not present with an acute X-ray finding like the steeple sign.<br>
            e. Correct. The "steeple sign" is a radiological finding on an anteroposterior (AP) view of the neck X-ray, indicating subglottic tracheal narrowing, which is characteristic of croup (acute laryngotracheobronchitis).

            a. True. Hoarseness of voice is the cardinal symptom of acute laryngitis.<br>
            b. True. A dry, non-productive cough and sore throat are common accompanying symptoms of acute laryngitis.<br>
            c. True. The vast majority of acute laryngitis cases are caused by viral infections.<br>
            d. False as a feature of acute laryngitis. Surgical emphysema (air in subcutaneous tissues) resulting from penetrating injuries to the neck or larynx is a traumatic condition, not a typical feature or complication of infectious acute laryngitis. This statement is the exception.<br>
            e. True. Voice rest (avoiding speaking or whispering), hydration (enhanced fluid intake), and humidification are cornerstones of managing acute laryngitis.

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. Correct. Acute epiglottitis involves inflammation and edema of the epiglottis and adjacent supraglottic structures, such as the aryepiglottic folds and arytenoids. The epiglottis itself is a supraglottic structure.<br>
            b. Incorrect. The glottis refers to the vocal cords and the space between them. While severe supraglottic swelling can affect glottic function, the primary pathology is above the glottis.<br>
            c. Incorrect. The subglottic area is below the vocal cords and is primarily affected in croup.<br>
            d. Incorrect. The nasopharynx is the part of the pharynx posterior to the nasal cavity and superior to the soft palate.<br>
            e. Incorrect. The oropharynx is the part of the pharynx posterior to the oral cavity, extending from the soft palate to the level of the hyoid bone. While infection can spread, epiglottitis is specifically supraglottic.

            a. Correct. Viral infections (e.g., rhinovirus, adenovirus, influenza, coronavirus, Epstein-Barr virus) are the most common cause of acute pharyngitis.<br>
            b. Incorrect. Bacterial infections, primarily Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), account for a smaller percentage of acute pharyngitis cases (about 5-15% in adults, higher in children).<br>
            c. Incorrect. Fungal pharyngitis (e.g., Candida) is uncommon in immunocompetent individuals but can occur in immunocompromised patients or after antibiotic/steroid use.<br>
            d. Incorrect. Trauma (e.g., chemical or physical injury) can cause pharyngeal irritation but is not a common cause of infectious-type acute pharyngitis.<br>

            Correct answer: E<br>
            a. Correct. As stated previously, most cases of acute pharyngitis are viral.<br>
            b. Correct. Gonococcal pharyngitis, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, can indeed be asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms, though it can also cause severe sore throat.<br>
            c. Correct. Viral pharyngitis is often part of a broader upper respiratory tract infection and is commonly associated with symptoms like rhinorrhea (runny nose). Hoarseness may occur if there is concurrent laryngitis. The infections are generally self-limiting.<br>
            d. Correct. Tender cervical lymphadenopathy, especially anterior cervical nodes, is a common finding in pharyngitis, particularly in bacterial infections like streptococcal pharyngitis. Significant lymphadenopathy often correlates with a more robust inflammatory response and can be seen in moderate to severe infections.<br>
            e. Correct. Since statements a, b, c, and d are all considered true aspects related to acute pharyngitis, this option is correct.

            a. Incorrect. Acute epiglottitis is predominantly caused by bacterial infections, classically Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), although other bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus) are increasingly common, especially in vaccinated populations. Viral causes are rare. Stating "Viral cause" as a general fact is misleading.<br>
            b. Incorrect. Acute epiglottitis can and does occur in adults, although its incidence in children has dramatically decreased due to Hib vaccination.<br>

            Correct answer: E<br>
            a. Incorrect. Acute epiglottitis can occur in adults, and its incidence in adults has relatively increased as childhood cases declined post-Hib vaccine.<br>
            b. Incorrect. Acute epiglottitis is usually caused by bacteria (e.g., H. influenzae type b, Streptococcus species). Viral causes are rare.<br>
            c. Incorrect. The absolute first priority in managing acute epiglottitis, especially if airway compromise is suspected or evident, is securing the airway. While antibiotics are a critical and urgent part of treatment, they follow or are concurrent with airway assessment and management. Stating it as the priority over airway is incorrect.<br>
            d. Incorrect. There is no strong evidence to suggest acute epiglottitis is more common in girls. Some studies suggest a slight male predominance, particularly in adults.<br>
            e. Correct. Since statements A, B, C, and D are all incorrect.

        <ul class="options">
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">A. Hot tonsillectomy is beneficial but dangerous</li>
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. Two attacks of Quinsy need tonsillectomy</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. True. Hot tonsillectomy (tonsillectomy during an acute quinsy episode) provides definitive treatment but carries higher risks (bleeding, airway difficulty) due to acute inflammation.<br>
            b. True. Recurrent peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) is a recognized indication for tonsillectomy. Two or more episodes usually warrant consideration for interval tonsillectomy.<br>
            c. False. Peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) is an accumulation of pus in the peritonsillar space, which is between the tonsillar capsule medially and the superior constrictor muscle laterally (and palatopharyngeus muscle posteriorly). The middle constrictor is lower.<br>
            d. True. Classic symptoms of quinsy include fever, trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), severe unilateral sore throat/odynophagia, and often referred unilateral otalgia.<br>
            e. True. Severe trismus, significant pain, dehydration, or risk of airway compromise often necessitate hospitalization for IV antibiotics, hydration, and drainage of the abscess.

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. True. Symptomatic or suspicious tonsillar cysts are a relative indication for tonsillectomy.<br>
            b. True. Failure to thrive in children, if attributable to tonsillar hypertrophy causing feeding difficulties or increased work of breathing, is a relative indication for tonsillectomy.<br>
            c. False (as an indication for tonsillectomy). Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is a surgical procedure for treating obstructive sleep apnea, and tonsillectomy is usually a component of UPPP if tonsils are present. UPPP itself is not an "indication for tonsillectomy"; rather, the condition UPPP treats (e.g., OSA) is the indication for UPPP (which includes tonsillectomy).<br>
            d. True. Sleep apnea syndrome (obstructive sleep apnea) due to tonsillar hypertrophy is a strong indication for tonsillectomy. While it can be considered an absolute indication in children, it can be listed as a relative indication in adults or under broader criteria.<br>
            e. False. Since C is not a direct relative indication for tonsillectomy, "All of the above" is incorrect.<br>
            Self-correction during thought process: The initial analysis for this question was complex due to wording. Option C stands out as not being an "indication" for tonsillectomy itself, but rather a procedure that includes it.

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. True (as a situation where tonsillectomy might be performed, thus a 'relative' context). Tonsillectomy may be performed to gain access for glossopharyngeal neurectomy or if the tonsil is involved in the pathology causing neuralgia. It's not a primary indication for tonsillectomy itself, but in the context of needing a neurectomy, it can become a relative consideration.<br>
            b. True. Tonsillectomy is commonly performed as part of a Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) procedure for sleep apnea.<br>
            c. False (as a relative indication). Suspicion of tonsillar malignancy (e.g., unilateral enlargement, ulceration) is an absolute indication for tonsillectomy (for diagnosis and treatment), not merely a relative one. Therefore, this is the "except".<br>
            d. True. Failure to thrive related to tonsillar issues is a relative indication for tonsillectomy.

        <ul class="options">
            <li class="option" data-correct="false">A. Clinical feature are thick speech and halitosis</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. True. Chronic tonsillitis can lead to halitosis (due to debris in crypts) and, if tonsils are very large, a muffled or "thick" quality to the speech.<br>
            b. True. Failure to thrive, if linked to chronic or recurrent tonsillitis (e.g., poor appetite, frequent illness, difficulty swallowing due to hypertrophy), is a relative indication for tonsillectomy.<br>
            c. Arguably False/Least True as a direct "complication". Compensatory hypertrophy of lingual tonsils can occur after palatine tonsillectomy, and these hypertrophied lingual tonsils can subsequently become inflamed (lingual tonsillitis). However, classifying this as a direct "complication" of the surgery is less accurate than other potential complications (e.g., bleeding, infection). It's more of an indirect, late sequela or physiological adaptation. Compared to other statements that are definitively true, this is the most contestable.<br>
            d. True. Primary post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage is, by definition, bleeding that occurs within the first 24 hours after surgery.<br>
            (Note: This question is problematic as A, B, and D are generally accepted as true. C is the most debatable as a "complication" versus a "sequela." Assuming the question seeks the least accurate or most debatable statement among generally true concepts.)

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. True. Unilateral odynophagia and referred otalgia are classic symptoms of quinsy.<br>
            b. True. Severe trismus is common and may necessitate hospitalization for management including potential airway monitoring, IV fluids, antibiotics, and drainage.<br>
            c. False. Quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) involves pus accumulation between the tonsillar capsule and the superior constrictor muscle, not the middle constrictor muscle.<br>
            d. True. Needle aspiration with a wide-bore needle is a common method for draining a peritonsillar abscess.<br>
            e. True. Examination findings include unilateral swelling of the soft palate, medial and often inferior displacement of the affected tonsil, and deviation of the uvula to the contralateral side.

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. True. Reactionary hemorrhage (also called primary hemorrhage) is defined as bleeding occurring within the first 24 hours after tonsillectomy.<br>
            b. Partially True/Misleading. While significant secondary hemorrhage (typically 5-10 days post-op) often requires surgical intervention, not all cases do; some minor bleeds may be managed conservatively. So "usually" might be an overstatement depending on severity.<br>
            c. True. Active infection at the time of tonsillectomy (e.g., "hot tonsillectomy" for quinsy) or severe pre-existing tonsillitis increases the risk of intraoperative and postoperative bleeding.<br>
            d. False. Hydrogen peroxide may be used as an adjunct (e.g., for oral hygiene or minor oozing), but it is not a primary or sole "line of treatment" for significant post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage, which requires direct pressure, cauterization, or ligation.<br>
            e. False. Hypotensive anesthesia is a technique used to reduce intraoperative bleeding. Reactionary hemorrhage occurs postoperatively and can be due to factors like clot dislodgement or increased blood pressure after anesthesia wears off. It's not "associated with" hypotensive anesthesia in a causative way; rather, hypotensive anesthesia aims to prevent it.<br>
            (Note: The question is poorly phrased as just a heading. Assuming it asks for the most accurate statement.)

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. True. Acute otitis media can result from the spread of infection from the nasopharynx (often inflamed during tonsillitis) via the Eustachian tube. This is a local/regional complication.<br>
            b. True. Parapharyngeal abscess is a deep neck space infection that can arise from the spread of tonsillar infection; it's a serious local complication.<br>
            c. False (as a local complication). Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is a systemic, non-suppurative immune-mediated complication that can follow acute streptococcal tonsillitis. It affects the kidneys, not the local pharyngeal area.<br>
            d. True. Peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) is a common local suppurative complication of acute tonsillitis.<br>
            e. True. Severe tonsillar swelling in acute tonsillitis can cause airway narrowing and respiratory obstruction, particularly in children. This is a local complication.

            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. False. Chronic tonsillitis is characterized by persistent or recurrent symptoms over a longer duration (months to years) or frequent acute episodes, not a single episode lasting three weeks.<br>
            b. False. While acute tonsillitis is often viral, chronic tonsillitis is more associated with persistent bacterial colonization, biofilms, and recurrent bacterial infections within the tonsillar crypts.<br>
            c. True. Persistent or recurrently enlarged and often tender cervical lymph nodes (especially jugulodigastric) are a common finding in chronic tonsillitis.<br>
            d. False. Tonsillectomy is not indicated in all cases of chronic tonsillitis. Indications are based on specific criteria like the Paradise criteria (frequency and severity of episodes), impact on quality of life, or complications.

            Correct answer: b<br>
            a. Incorrect (as "best way"). Repeating incision/drainage and antibiotics treats the current acute episode but does not address the recurrent nature of the problem.<br>
            b. Correct. The patient has symptoms of acute peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) and a history of three prior episodes treated with incision and drainage. Recurrent peritonsillar abscess is a strong indication for interval tonsillectomy to prevent further recurrences. This is the best long-term management.<br>
            c. Incorrect (as "best way"). Antibiotics and steroids can help manage the acute episode but do not offer a definitive solution for recurrent quinsy.<br>
            d. Incorrect (as "best way"). Needle aspiration is a valid treatment for the current acute abscess, similar to incision and drainage, but like option 'a', it doesn't address the recurrence.<br>

            Correct answer: a<br>
            a. False (as a complication OF tonsillectomy). Peritonsillar abscess is a condition that tonsillectomy is often performed to treat (quinsy tonsillectomy) or prevent (if recurrent). It is not a complication caused by the tonsillectomy procedure itself.<br>
            b. True. Nasopharyngeal stenosis, though rare, can be a complication, particularly if adenoidectomy is performed concurrently or if there is extensive scarring from UPPP.<br>
            c. True. Bleeding (primary/reactionary or secondary) is a well-known and significant complication of tonsillectomy.<br>
            d. True. Referred otalgia (ear pain via glossopharyngeal nerve) is a very common and expected post-operative symptom, often considered a minor complication or sequela.<br>
            e. True. Trauma to teeth (chipping, loosening) can occur during intubation or insertion/manipulation of the mouth gag used during surgery.

            Correct answer: b<br>
            a. True. Most cases of acute tonsillitis are viral in origin.<br>
            b. False. Follicular tonsillitis is typically caused by bacteria such as Group A Streptococcus. Mycobacterium tuberculosis causing typical follicular tonsillitis is extremely rare and would present differently (e.g., as chronic tonsillar tuberculosis). This statement is highly inaccurate.<br>
            c. True. These clinical and laboratory findings are strong indicators of severe bacterial tonsillitis.<br>
            d. False. Antibiotics are indicated for bacterial tonsillitis, not viral. Routine use in all cases is inappropriate and contributes to antibiotic resistance.<br>
            e. True. The presence of a tonsillar membrane necessitates the exclusion of diphtheria, although other conditions like infectious mononucleosis or Vincent's angina can also cause membranes.<br>
            (Note: Both b and d are false statements. However, statement b posits a highly specific and incorrect etiological agent for a common presentation, making it exceptionally false from a microbiological standpoint.)

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: d<br>
            a. True. Acute retropharyngeal abscess is more common in young children (typically < 5 years) due to the presence of retropharyngeal lymph nodes (of Rouvière) which tend to atrophy with age.<br>
            b. True. Swelling in the retropharyngeal space can cause airway obstruction (difficulty breathing, stridor) and dysphagia or odynophagia (difficulty suckling/swallowing).<br>
            c. Generally True. The retropharyngeal space has a midline raphe, so abscesses often present as a unilateral or paramedian swelling on the posterior pharyngeal wall. While large ones can cross, "limited to one side" is a common description.<br>
            d. False. The preferred method for draining most acute retropharyngeal abscesses is transoral incision and drainage. An external approach is reserved for complex cases (e.g., extension into other neck spaces, failure of transoral drainage) and is carefully planned to avoid major neurovascular structures; draining "through the carotid sheath" is not standard and would be dangerous.<br>
            e. True. In children, these abscesses often arise from suppuration of the retropharyngeal lymph nodes, typically secondary to an upper respiratory tract infection.

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. False. The statement describes secondary hemorrhage (occurs 5-10 days post-op, often due to infection and sloughing of eschar). Reactionary (or primary) hemorrhage occurs within the first 24 hours after surgery. This statement incorrectly labels secondary bleeding characteristics as reactionary.<br>
            b. True. Nasopharyngeal stenosis is a rare but possible complication, particularly if adenoidectomy or aggressive palatal surgery is performed with tonsillectomy.<br>
            c. True. If tonsillar tissue is incompletely removed, these remnants can become inflamed, leading to residual tonsillitis or recurrent symptoms.<br>

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: a<br>
            a. Correct. Unilateral tonsillar enlargement, especially with ulceration, in an adult that persists despite medical treatment, is highly suspicious for malignancy. Tonsillectomy for biopsy and diagnosis (and potential treatment) is strongly indicated.<br>
            b. Incorrect (as a definitive "need"). Two attacks of sore throat are generally insufficient to meet standard criteria (e.g., Paradise criteria) for tonsillectomy due to recurrent tonsillitis without more specific details on severity and frequency over time.<br>
            c. Incorrect (as a definitive "need"). While a single episode of peritonsillar abscess can be an indication for tonsillectomy in some cases (e.g., severe episode, comorbid factors), it's more commonly recommended after a second episode. One attack alone is often managed conservatively with drainage and antibiotics, followed by observation.<br>
            d. Incorrect. Nasal obstruction in a child is primarily addressed by assessing for and treating adenoid hypertrophy (adenoidectomy) or other nasal causes (e.g., allergic rhinitis, septal deviation). While massive tonsils can contribute to oropharyngeal obstruction affecting breathing, "nasal obstruction" alone points more to adenoids.<br>
            e. Incorrect. Option 'a' presents a clear need for tonsillectomy.

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. Incorrect. Vincent angina (acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis) is a superficial infection of the gums and oral mucosa, not primarily a deep neck space infection involving submental and submandibular spaces.<br>
            b. Correct. Assuming "Ludwig's tumor" is a typographical error for "Ludwig's angina," this is the correct answer. Ludwig's angina is a rapidly spreading, bilateral cellulitis of the sublingual, submental, and submandibular spaces, often originating from an odontogenic infection.<br>
            c. Incorrect. Submandibular sialadenitis is an inflammation of the submandibular salivary gland, typically confined to the gland within the submandibular space, not necessarily a diffuse infection involving both submental and submandibular spaces as described.<br>
            d. Incorrect. Quinsy abscess (peritonsillar abscess) is a collection of pus in the peritonsillar space, located superior and lateral to the tonsil, not in the submental or submandibular spaces.<br>
            e. Incorrect. A Bezold abscess is a deep neck abscess resulting from the spread of infection from acute mastoiditis, typically tracking along the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which is different from the submental/submandibular spaces.

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. True. The lingual nerve has a close anatomical relationship with the submandibular gland and its duct (Wharton's duct), looping under the duct.<br>
            b. True. The total daily saliva production is typically estimated to be between 0.5 to 1.5 liters. The range of 1-1.5 L is within this accepted volume.<br>
            c. False. The majority (approximately 75-80%) of parotid gland tumors are benign. Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign tumor. Therefore, this statement is false and the correct answer.<br>
            d. True. There are numerous minor salivary glands (estimated to be several hundred, e.g., 600-1000) distributed throughout the oral cavity and upper aerodigestive tract. "About 400" is a plausible estimate in this context.

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. False. The sublingual gland is generally described as lacking a distinct, well-formed fibrous capsule; instead, it is a collection of smaller glandular units embedded in connective tissue of the floor of the mouth. Therefore, "covered by tight capsule" is incorrect.<br>
            b. False. The secretion of the submandibular gland is mixed (seromucous), not solely mucous. While it contains mucous components making it more viscous than parotid saliva, it also has significant serous components. Stating it is mucous (implying predominantly or solely) is an inaccurate simplification.<br>
            c. True. The majority of parotid gland tumors (around 75-80%) are benign.<br>
            d. True. Sialadenosis (non-inflammatory, non-neoplastic bilateral salivary gland enlargement) can be associated with various conditions, including eating disorders like bulimia nervosa.<br>
            e. True. For chronic sialadenitis that is recurrent, symptomatic, and refractory to conservative management, surgical excision of the affected gland (e.g., submandibulectomy) is a recognized treatment option.<br>
            (Note: Both options 'a' and 'b' are factually incorrect. Option 'a' describes an anatomical inaccuracy. Option 'b' describes a physiological inaccuracy. In the context of such questions, the most unequivocally false statement is usually sought. The lack of a tight capsule for the sublingual gland is a more definitive anatomical distinction compared to the precise characterization of mixed secretions.)

            a. True. The parotid gland produces purely serous saliva.<br>
            b. True. The mylohyoid muscle anatomically divides the submandibular gland into a larger superficial lobe and a smaller deep lobe that wraps around the posterior border of the muscle.<br>
            c. True. Minor salivary glands contribute approximately 5-10% of the total saliva volume.<br>
            d. False. Tumors of the sublingual gland are rare, but unlike parotid and submandibular tumors, a significantly higher proportion (around 70-90%) of sublingual gland tumors are malignant. Therefore, the statement "Sublingual gland tumors mostly benign" is false.<br>
            e. True. Sialography, an imaging technique involving injection of contrast into the salivary ducts, is beneficial for diagnosing various salivary gland disorders, such as sialolithiasis, ductal strictures, and some masses or inflammatory conditions.

            c. Incorrect. While a cuffed metal tube would offer protection, plastic tubes are generally preferred for cuffed applications in modern practice due to material properties (e.g., MRI compatibility, less thermal conductivity).<br>
            d. Correct. A cuffed tracheostomy tube, typically made of plastic, is used to seal the airway, protecting the lower airways from aspiration and allowing for positive pressure ventilation.

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. True. A fenestrated tube, when the inner cannula is removed (or a fenestrated inner cannula is used) and the cuff is deflated, allows air to pass through the fenestrations and up to the vocal cords, enabling speech with a speaking valve.<br>
            b. False. A cuffed tube can lead to mucosal necrosis due to pressure if it is over-inflated or if proper cuff pressure management is not maintained. If the cuff is not inflated, it fails to protect the airway from aspiration but does not cause pressure necrosis from the cuff itself.<br>
            c. True. Tracheostomized patients often have difficulty clearing secretions and require frequent suctioning to maintain tube patency and prevent obstruction.<br>
            d. True. Subcutaneous emphysema can occur as an early complication, especially if there is a poor seal around the stoma or if air dissects into the pretracheal tissues.<br>
            e. True. Patients with tracheostomies, especially when the cuff is inflated or they cannot use a speaking valve, will often need alternative means of communication like writing.

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: E<br>
            a. Incorrect. Vocal cord polyps are typically managed with microlaryngoscopy and excision, not tracheostomy.<br>
            b. Incorrect. Unilateral vocal cord palsy usually does not cause severe airway obstruction requiring tracheostomy, though voice and aspiration may be issues. Bilateral palsy in adduction is an indication.<br>
            c. Incorrect, as a primary choice. While a foreign body impacted near the carina causing severe obstruction that cannot be removed bronchoscopically might ultimately require a tracheostomy for airway control, the primary approach is bronchoscopic removal. Tracheostomy is not the first-line indication for all such foreign bodies.<br>
            d. Incorrect. An isolated fracture of the nasal bone does not typically require tracheostomy.<br>
            e. Correct. Severe maxillofacial trauma often leads to airway compromise due to bleeding, edema, or anatomical disruption, making endotracheal intubation difficult or impossible. In such cases, tracheostomy (or cricothyrotomy) is indicated to secure the airway. This is a classic and strong indication.

            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. True. Tube displacement or obstruction by mucus plugs are common complications.<br>
            b. False as a likely complication. Air embolism is primarily a risk with injury to large veins (e.g., internal jugular vein), allowing air to be entrained into the venous system. Injury to the common carotid artery would lead to massive arterial hemorrhage; air embolism is not a direct or typical consequence of isolated arterial injury.<br>
            c. True. Subglottic stenosis, tracheal stenosis at the stoma site, or at the cuff site are known late complications.<br>
            d. True. Bronchitis or tracheobronchitis can occur due to bypassing the natural humidification and filtering mechanisms of the upper airway or from infection.<br>
            e. True. Fistula formation, such as tracheoesophageal fistula or tracheo-innominate artery fistula (a catastrophic late complication), can occur. Tracheocutaneous fistula can also persist after decannulation.

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. True. Prolonged intubation increases the duration of pressure and irritation to laryngeal tissues, predisposing to trauma (e.g., ulceration, granuloma formation, stenosis).<br>
            b. False. An inappropriately large endotracheal tube is more likely to cause direct pressure trauma. While a tube that is too small might lead to problems like air leak (requiring higher cuff pressures, which then cause trauma) or increased tube movement, the small size itself is not a direct cause of pressure trauma in the same way a large tube is. The question asks for factors that predispose to trauma. A large tube is a more direct traumatic factor than a small one.<br>
            c. True. An over-inflated cuff exerts excessive pressure on the tracheal mucosa, leading to ischemia, ulceration, and potentially stenosis.<br>
            d. True. Excessive movement of the endotracheal tube, due to patient agitation, coughing, or inadequate fixation, can cause friction and direct trauma to the larynx and trachea.

            Correct answer: D<br>
            a. Incorrect. While controlling hemorrhage is vital (the 'C' in ABCs - Circulation), airway ('A') takes precedence in a patient with severe respiratory distress and stridor.<br>
            b. Incorrect. Diagnostic imaging like a CT scan should be deferred until the airway is secured and the patient is stabilized.<br>
            c. Incorrect. Attempting fiberoptic laryngoscopy in the presence of significant facial/neck trauma and hemoptysis may be difficult, time-consuming, and may not provide a definitive airway quickly enough.<br>
            d. Correct. In a patient with severe respiratory distress, stridor, and significant trauma to the face and neck (suggesting a potentially difficult or impossible airway to secure via endotracheal intubation from above), securing the airway with a surgical airway (tracheostomy or emergent cricothyrotomy) is often the most appropriate and life-saving first definitive measure.<br>
            e. Incorrect. Direct laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation may be extremely difficult or contraindicated due to anatomical disruption, swelling, bleeding, or potential for further injury (e.g., unstable cervical spine, laryngeal fracture).

            (This question is poorly phrased. Assuming it means "All are indications for tracheostomy except:")<br>
            a. True. Flail chest often leads to respiratory failure requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation, for which tracheostomy is indicated.<br>
            b. True. Bilateral vocal cord paralysis in the adducted position causes critical upper airway obstruction, necessitating tracheostomy.<br>
            c. True. Laryngeal cancer can cause upper airway obstruction requiring tracheostomy. Tracheostomy may also be performed prophylactically before major surgery or radiotherapy for laryngeal cancer.<br>
            d. False as an indication for bypassing upper airway obstruction. Bronchogenic carcinoma (lung cancer) is a disease of the lower airways. While patients with advanced lung cancer might require tracheostomy for prolonged ventilation due to respiratory failure, the bronchogenic cancer itself does not typically cause an upper airway obstruction that is bypassed by a tracheostomy.

            d. False. Routine intermittent cuff deflation (e.g., every 24 hours for 5 minutes) is generally not recommended as a standard practice. It can increase the risk of aspiration. Proper cuff management involves maintaining the lowest possible cuff pressure that provides an adequate seal (e.g., minimal occluding volume or minimal leak technique) and regular monitoring of cuff pressure.<br>

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: E<br>
            a. Incorrect. While juvenile respiratory papillomatosis (JRP) can involve any part of the larynx and tracheobronchial tree, the glottis (vocal cords) is the most commonly affected site. Supraglottic involvement is also common. Isolated or primary subglottic involvement as the most common is not accurate.<br>
            b. Incorrect. JRP is primarily a disease of infants and young children, typically acquired from maternal HPV infection during birth. Adult-onset respiratory papillomatosis exists but is distinct from JRP.<br>
            c. Incorrect. Radiotherapy is generally contraindicated for JRP due to the risk of inducing malignant transformation of the benign papillomas.<br>
            d. Incorrect. Tracheostomy is a measure of last resort for severe, life-threatening airway obstruction that cannot be managed by repeated surgical debulking. It is not a routine early intervention and is avoided if possible due to potential complications, including distal spread of papillomas.<br>
            e. Correct. The hallmark of JRP is its tendency for frequent recurrence, necessitating multiple surgical procedures (e.g., microdebridement, CO2 laser ablation) to maintain airway patency and voice quality.

            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. True. Esophageal speech is a method of voice restoration.<br>
            b. False. "Nasal speech" typically refers to speech quality (hypernasality or hyponasality) related to velopharyngeal function or nasal resonance, not a primary method of alaryngeal voice production after total laryngectomy. This is the exception.<br>

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: A<br>
            a. Correct. Early-stage glottic cancers (tumors confined to the true vocal cords) generally have the best prognosis among laryngeal cancers. This is due to early symptom presentation (hoarseness) and relatively sparse lymphatic drainage of the true vocal cords, leading to later metastasis.<br>
            b. Incorrect. Subglottic cancers tend to have a poorer prognosis due to often late presentation and aggressive behavior with early spread.<br>
            c. Incorrect. Supraglottic cancers have a richer lymphatic drainage than glottic cancers and thus a higher propensity for early nodal metastasis, generally leading to a worse prognosis than early glottic cancers.<br>
            d. Incorrect. Prognosis varies significantly by site.<br>

            Correct answer: E<br>
            a. Incorrect. Juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis is caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV), most commonly types 6 and 11.<br>
            b. Incorrect. Papillomas are often multiple and can be widespread.<br>
            c. Incorrect. Juvenile laryngeal papillomas have a high propensity for recurrence.<br>
            d. Incorrect. Malignant transformation is rare, although it can occur (more associated with adult-onset or certain HPV types, or after radiotherapy). It is not a usual outcome.<br>
            e. Correct. Spontaneous regression of juvenile laryngeal papillomas can occur, particularly around the time of puberty, although it is not predictable and many patients require long-term treatment.

            Correct answer: E<br>
            a. Incorrect. CT scan is used for staging and assessing the extent of the tumor, not for initial diagnosis of the nature of the ulcer.<br>
            b. Incorrect. MRI is also an imaging tool for staging, particularly for soft tissue detail.<br>
            c. Incorrect. Ultrasound is not typically used for diagnosing a vocal cord lesion.<br>
            d. Incorrect. While HPV is associated with some laryngeal pathologies, a viral study alone is not the primary diagnostic test for an ulcerative mass suspicious for cancer.<br>
            e. Correct. For an ulcerative mass on the vocal cord, direct visualization via endoscopy (laryngoscopy) and obtaining a tissue sample (biopsy) for histopathological examination is the definitive diagnostic test to determine if it is cancerous or due to another cause.

        </ul>
        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. Incorrect. The glottic region is the most common site (around 60-65%), not the supraglottic region at 67%. Supraglottic region accounts for about 30-35%.<br>
            b. Incorrect while plausible as high, "90%" might be too specific without context. Laryngeal cancer is significantly more common in males than females (historically ratios of 5:1 to 10:1, though the gap is narrowing). While male predominance is high, 90% as a fixed statistic is debatable and potentially too high for all populations/contexts.<br>
            c. Correct. Squamous cell carcinoma is overwhelmingly the most common histological type of laryngeal cancer, accounting for more than 90% of cases (94% is a reasonable and often cited figure).<br>
            d. Ambiguous and likely incorrect. This statement is poorly worded. If it means 50% of laryngeal cancer cases occur in smoker and alcoholic males, it is likely an underestimate, as smoking and alcohol are major risk factors. If it means the risk for a smoker/alcoholic male to develop laryngeal cancer is 50%, this is incorrect.

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: C<br>
            a. (Incorrect) While nasal obstruction can be related to sinus issues, the constellation of open lip posture and prominent upper teeth (adenoid facies) points more directly towards chronic nasopharyngeal obstruction, making post nasal space X-ray more specific for initial assessment of adenoids.<br>
            b. (Incorrect) A chest X-ray is not indicated for these upper airway symptoms.<br>
            c. (Correct) Open lip posture, prominent upper teeth, and nasal obstruction are classic features of "adenoid facies," often due to adenoid hypertrophy. A lateral view X-ray of the post nasal space is a common investigation to assess the size of the adenoid pad in the nasopharynx.<br>
            d. (Incorrect) A general skull X-ray is not the primary investigation for these specific signs.<br>

        <p class="explanation">
            Correct answer: B<br>
            a. (True) Chronic or recurrent otitis media with effusion (OME) that is persistent and causing hearing loss or other complications is a common indication for adenoidectomy, as adenoids can obstruct the Eustachian tube or act as a reservoir of infection.<br>
            b. (False) Cleft palate itself is not a primary indication for adenoidectomy. While children with cleft palate often have Eustachian tube dysfunction and may undergo adenoidectomy in specific circumstances (e.g., for OME), it's done with caution as adenoidectomy can worsen velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) in these patients. Therefore, it is the exception as a general indication.<br>
            c. (True) Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or significant sleep-disordered breathing due to adenoid hypertrophy is a strong indication for adenoidectomy.<br>
            d. (True) Recurrent acute otitis media is also an indication for adenoidectomy, often considered alongside tympanostomy tube insertion.<br>
            e. (True) Significant nasal obstruction causing chronic mouth breathing, adenoid facies, or hyponasal speech due to adenoid hypertrophy is an indication for adenoidectomy.
