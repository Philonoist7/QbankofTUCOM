        <h2 class="section-title">G1 Question</h2>

        <div class="question-container" data-question-id="1.1">
            <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">1.</span> A 55-year-old woman presents with a first episode of PMB (Postmenopausal Bleeding). Transvaginal ultrasound scan showed an endometrial thickness of 3.8 mm. What is the most appropriate management plan?</p>
            <ul class="options">
                <li class="option" data-correct="true">A. Book a repeat transvaginal scan in 6 months</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. Book for an out-patient hysteroscopy to look at endometrial cavity and obtain endometrial sample</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">C. Perform a dilatation and curettage</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">D. Perform an endometrial sampling to rule out endometrial cancer</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: For postmenopausal bleeding (PMB), an endometrial thickness of â‰¤ 4 mm on transvaginal ultrasound has a high negative predictive value for endometrial cancer. With an endometrial thickness of 3.8 mm and a first episode of PMB, reassurance and observation with a plan for further investigation if bleeding recurs or persists is often appropriate. A repeat scan in 6 months is a reasonable conservative approach if the bleeding settles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-container" data-question-id="1.2">
            <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">2.</span> A 60-year-old undergoes hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy for grade 1 endometrial cancer.

            <ul class="options">
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">A. Stage IC</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. Stage IC</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="true">C. Stage IIIA</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">D. Stage IIIB</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">E. Stage IIIC</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: FIGO Staging for Endometrial Cancer: Stage IIIA involves tumor invading the serosa of the corpus uteri and/or adnexa. Invasion of the uterine serosa corresponds to Stage IIIA.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-container" data-question-id="1.3">

        <div class="question-container" data-question-id="1.1">
            <p class="question-text"><span class="question-number">1.</span> After menopause obese patients have less chances of occurrence of osteoporosis because of:</p>
            <ul class="options">
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">A. Fall in FSH level</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">B. Fall in LH level</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="true">C. Conversion of more androgens into estrogen</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="false">D. Conversion of more estrogen into androgen</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: After menopause, ovarian estrogen production ceases. However, some estrogen is still produced in peripheral tissues, primarily adipose tissue (fat), by the aromatization of androgens (produced by the adrenal glands and ovaries) into estrogens. Obese women have more adipose tissue. Adipose tissue contains the enzyme aromatase, which converts androgens (like androstenedione from the adrenals) into estrone (a type of estrogen). This peripheral conversion provides a source of estrogen postmenopausally. Higher estrogen levels offer some protection against bone loss, thus reducing the chances of osteoporosis compared to non-obese postmenopausal women with lower estrogen levels.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Menopause is associated with estrogen deficiency, which leads to several atrophic changes in the reproductive organs. (a) The uterus typically decreases in size. (b) Vaginal atrophy is common. (c) Ovaries cease follicular activity and significantly shrink in size. Therefore, all listed changes occur.</p>

                <li class="option" data-correct="false">C. After menarche the ratio between uterine body and cervix becomes about 2:1 or 3:1</li>
                <li class="option" data-correct="true">D. After menopause the ratio remains 3:1</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: The ratio of the uterine body (corpus) to the cervix changes. At birth, it's about 1:2. After menarche, it becomes about 2:1 or 3:1. After menopause, due to estrogen withdrawal, the uterine body tends to atrophy more significantly than the cervix, so the ratio may revert towards 1:1 or the body shrinks proportionally more; it does not remain 3:1.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Serial Î²-hCG measurements (typically every 48-72 hours) are critical to assess the viability and likely location of an early pregnancy. Suboptimal rise, plateau, or fall can suggest ectopic pregnancy or non-viable IUP. Î²-hCG confirms pregnancy but doesn't diagnose ectopic pregnancy alone; it's part of the workup with ultrasound.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: A typical menstrual cycle is defined as the time from the first day of one menstrual period to the first day of the next. While cycle length can vary among women and even from cycle to cycle for an individual, the average duration is considered to be 28 days.
a) 14 days: This is often the approximate time of ovulation in a 28-day cycle (i.e., the follicular phase length), not the total cycle length.
b) 21 days: This is considered a short but still potentially normal cycle length. The normal range is typically cited as 21 to 35 days.
c) 28 days: This is the conventionally accepted average duration.
d) 35 days: This is considered a long but still potentially normal cycle length.</p>

                <li class="option" data-correct="false">d) Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: a) Progesterone: Progesterone levels rise after ovulation, produced by the corpus luteum. It helps prepare the endometrium for pregnancy and inhibits further ovulation.
b) Estrogen: Rising estrogen levels from the maturing ovarian follicle have a positive feedback effect on the pituitary gland, which contributes to the LH surge. However, estrogen itself does not directly trigger ovulation.
c) Luteinizing hormone (LH): A rapid and significant increase in LH, known as the LH surge, is the primary trigger for the final maturation of the ovarian follicle and the release of the ovum (ovulation), typically occurring about 24-36 hours after the onset of the surge.
d) Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): FSH is primarily responsible for stimulating the growth and development of ovarian follicles in the first half of the menstrual cycle (follicular phase). While there is a smaller FSH surge concurrent with the LH surge, LH is the main trigger for ovulation.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: a) Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome: This is a congenital disorder characterized by MÃ¼llerian agenesis, meaning the uterus and upper part of the vagina do not develop properly or are absent. Ovarian function is typically normal.
b) Asherman's syndrome: This is an acquired condition characterized by intrauterine adhesions (scar tissue) that can obliterate the uterine cavity, often following uterine instrumentation like D&C. The uterus is present but damaged.
c) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): This is an endocrine disorder affecting ovarian function and androgen levels. The uterus is present.
d) Turner syndrome (45,X0): This is a chromosomal disorder primarily affecting ovarian development, often leading to streak ovaries and primary ovarian insufficiency. The uterus is usually present but may be infantile due to lack of estrogen stimulation.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Uterine didelphys is a type of MÃ¼llerian duct anomaly resulting from the complete failure of fusion of the two MÃ¼llerian ducts.
a) Absent uterus: This describes MRKH syndrome or complete uterine agenesis.
b) Two separate uterine cavities: In uterine didelphys, there are two separate uterine horns (each a hemi-uterus), often two separate cervices, and sometimes a longitudinal vaginal septum. Each horn functions as a separate uterine cavity.
c) Narrow uterine cavity: While individual horns might be smaller than a normal single uterus, the defining feature is duplication, not primarily narrowness. A narrow cavity might be seen in other conditions like a T-shaped uterus (e.g., from DES exposure).
D) Malformed fallopian tubes: While MÃ¼llerian anomalies can sometimes be associated with other urogenital tract anomalies, the defining feature of uterine didelphys relates to the uterus and cervix. Fallopian tubes develop from the cranial part of the MÃ¼llerian ducts and are generally present, though their connection to the duplicated horns might be considered part of the overall anomaly. However, "two separate uterine cavities" is the direct characterization.</p>

            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Normal female puberty typically begins between the ages of 8 and 13 years. The first sign is usually thelarche (breast development).
a) 6-7 years: Onset of puberty before age 8 in girls is considered precocious puberty.
b) 8-13 years: This is the generally accepted age range for the onset of normal puberty in girls.

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Intersex conditions, now more commonly referred to as Differences of Sex Development (DSD), are conditions where a person's chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical.
a) Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY): Affects males, leading to hypogonadism. It is a DSD.
b) Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS): Individuals are 46,XY (genetically male) but their bodies are unable to respond to androgens, resulting in female external genitalia and development. This is a classic example of DSD.
c) Turner syndrome (45,X0): Affects females, leading to ovarian dysgenesis. It is also a DSD.
d) Down syndrome (Trisomy 21): A chromosomal disorder causing intellectual disability and characteristic physical features, but not primarily an intersex condition in the sense of discordant sex development components.
Note: Both Klinefelter syndrome, Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, and Turner Syndrome are considered DSDs. The question asks for "an example." Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome is a very clear example where chromosomal sex and phenotypic sex are discordant.

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: The presentation of intersex conditions (DSDs) is diverse.
a) Typical male or female genitalia: Some DSDs may present with external genitalia that appear typically male or female, but there might be underlying chromosomal or gonadal discordance (e.g., some forms of AIS, complete gonadal dysgenesis).
b) Ambiguous genitalia: This is a common presentation where the external genitalia do not appear clearly male or female.
c) No external genitalia: This is not a typical presentation. DSDs involve variations in the development of genitalia, not usually their complete absence. However, "atypical" could be interpreted broadly.
d) All of the above: Given that individuals can present with seemingly typical genitalia (option a) or ambiguous genitalia (option b), option d is the intended encompassing answer, despite option c being problematic in its strict wording. The question likely intends to cover the wide spectrum of anatomical variations.</p>

a) The absence of menstruation by age 14 without secondary sexual characteristics: This aligns closely with one part of the definition (though age 13 is often cited for absence of secondary characteristics). It is the best fit among the options.
b) Heavy menstrual bleeding: This is menorrhagia, not amenorrhea.

            <p class="explanation">Explanation: a) Turner syndrome (45,X0): This chromosomal disorder leads to gonadal dysgenesis (streak ovaries), resulting in primary ovarian insufficiency and is a common cause of primary amenorrhea (due to lack of estrogen and ovarian function).
b) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): PCOS typically causes oligo-ovulation or anovulation, leading to irregular periods (oligomenorrhea) or secondary amenorrhea. It is less commonly a cause of true primary amenorrhea, although it can manifest early.
c) Uterine fibroids: These are benign uterine tumors that usually cause heavy menstrual bleeding or pelvic pressure, not typically primary amenorrhea, unless a very large cervical fibroid obstructs outflow (rare for primary presentation).

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Secondary amenorrhea is the cessation of menstruation in a woman who has previously menstruated.
a) Menstruation that occurs only twice per year: This would be classified as severe oligomenorrhea (infrequent menstruation), not amenorrhea.
b) The absence of menstruation for 3 months in a woman who previously had regular cycles: This is a standard definition for secondary amenorrhea. Another definition is the absence of menses for 6 months in a woman with previously irregular cycles.
c) Menstruation after age 55: This would be postmenopausal bleeding if menopause had already occurred. Menopause is the cessation of menses, typically around age 51.
d) Menstrual bleeding that lasts longer than 7 days: This is prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia if heavy, or simply prolonged flow).</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: a) Pregnancy: This is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea in women of reproductive age and must always be excluded first.
b) Turner syndrome: Typically causes primary amenorrhea due to gonadal dysgenesis.
c) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH): Severe forms can cause primary amenorrhea or virilization. Non-classical CAH can cause oligomenorrhea or secondary amenorrhea, but pregnancy and PCOS are generally more common overall.
d) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): A very common cause of oligomenorrhea and secondary amenorrhea due to chronic anovulation. While PCOS is very common, pregnancy is the absolute most frequent physiological reason for menses to stop.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) can occur at various stages of life.
a) Childhood (pre-pubertal): Vaginal bleeding in childhood is abnormal and requires investigation.
b) Adolescence: AUB is common in adolescence, often due to anovulatory cycles.
c) Perimenopause: AUB is very common during perimenopause due to fluctuating hormone levels, anovulatory cycles, and an increased incidence of benign pathologies. This phase is particularly notorious for AUB.
d) Postmenopause: Any vaginal bleeding after menopause is abnormal (postmenopausal bleeding - PMB) and requires investigation.
While AUB is common in adolescence and always a concern in postmenopause, perimenopause is a period where AUB due to hormonal changes and emerging pathologies is extremely frequent.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: a) Uterine fibroids: A common cause of AUB, particularly heavy menstrual bleeding.
b) Pregnancy: Complications of early pregnancy (e.g., miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy) are important causes of AUB.
c) Cervical cancer: Can cause intermenstrual bleeding, postcoital bleeding, or heavy/irregular bleeding.
d) Normal ovulation: Normal ovulatory cycles are associated with regular, predictable menstrual bleeding. While ovulation itself is a process, it leads to normal menses, not abnormal uterine bleeding. Anovulation, in contrast, is a common cause of AUB.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: a) Uterine cancer (Endometrial cancer): Must always be ruled out in PMB and accounts for about 10% of cases.
b) Endometrial atrophy (or atrophic vaginitis/endometritis): This is the most common cause of postmenopausal bleeding. The thinning and fragility of the estrogen-deprived endometrium and vaginal lining can lead to bleeding.
c) Ovulation: Ovulation ceases with menopause, so it cannot be a cause of PMB.
d) Uterine fibroids: While fibroids can persist into menopause, they usually shrink due to lack of estrogen and are less likely to be a new cause of bleeding postmenopausally, though pre-existing ones might still contribute in some cases or if the woman is on HRT. Atrophy is more common overall.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: The primary concern with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) is to exclude malignancy.
a) Pregnancy: By definition, menopause means cessation of ovulation and reproductive capability, so pregnancy is not a consideration.
b) Uterine fibroids: Can be a cause, but malignancy is the priority to rule out.
c) Endometrial cancer: This is the most serious potential cause of PMB and must always be investigated and excluded. Approximately 10% of women with PMB will have endometrial cancer.
d) Polycystic ovary syndrome: PCOS is a condition of reproductive age and is not relevant to postmenopausal bleeding causes.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) is not a true infection by a single organism but rather a polymicrobial syndrome characterized by a shift in the vaginal flora. There is a decrease in the normally predominant lactobacilli and an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria.
a) Candida albicans: Causes vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection).
b) Gardnerella vaginalis: This bacterium is almost always present in high concentrations in women with BV and is a key component of the altered flora. While not the sole "cause," it's a hallmark organism and often cited as the predominant one in the complex.
c) Trichomonas vaginalis: Causes trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection.
d) Escherichia coli: A common cause of urinary tract infections; can sometimes contaminate the vagina but is not the primary cause of BV.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: PID is an infection of the upper female genital tract (uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries).
a) Human papillomavirus (HPV): Causes genital warts and is linked to cervical and other cancers, but not typically PID.
b) Neisseria gonorrhoeae: This, along with Chlamydia trachomatis, are the most common bacterial pathogens responsible for PID. They are usually sexually transmitted. Since Chlamydia trachomatis is not an option, Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the best choice.
c) Staphylococcus aureus: Can cause various infections but is not a primary common cause of PID.
d) Candida albicans: Causes vaginal yeast infections, not typically ascending infection leading to PID.</p>

            <p class="explanation">Explanation: The classic symptoms of endometriosis include: Dysmenorrhea (painful periods), Chronic pelvic pain, Deep dyspareunia (painful intercourse), Dyschezia (painful bowel movements), Dysuria (painful urination), and Subfertility.
a) Heavy menstrual bleeding (Menorrhagia): Can sometimes be associated, but severe pain is more characteristic.
b) Severe pelvic pain: This is a hallmark symptom, often cyclical (dysmenorrhea) but can also be chronic.
c) Increased urination: Can occur if endometriotic lesions affect the bladder, but not as universally common as pain.

a) Intramural: Within the muscular wall of the uterus.
b) Submucosal: Beneath the endometrium, protruding into the uterine cavity.
c) Subserosal: On the outer surface of the uterus, protruding into the pelvic cavity. These grow "outside" the main uterine wall structure.
d) Pedunculated: Attached by a stalk; can be pedunculated submucosal or subserosal. While a pedunculated subserosal fibroid is outside, "Subserosal" is the general category for those on the outer surface.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Emergency contraception (EC) is most effective when taken ASAP.
a) Within 24 hours of unprotected intercourse: Efficacy is highest during this period for oral EC pills.
b) Between 48-72 hours post-intercourse: Efficacy decreases but still effective for some pills up to 72 hours (levonorgestrel) or 120 hours (ulipristal acetate).
c) Within 5 days of intercourse, regardless of timing: True for ulipristal acetate pills and copper IUD.
d) Only if taken immediately: While "immediately" is best, there's a window.
"Most effective" implies peak effectiveness, which is achieved when taken earliest. So, (a) is the best answer reflecting highest efficacy for oral methods.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Puberty encompasses a series of physical changes as a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. (a) Breast development (thelarche): One of the earliest signs of puberty in girls. (b) Growth of pubic and axillary hair (pubarche/adrenarche): Driven by androgens from the adrenal glands and later the gonads. (c) Menstruation (menarche): The onset of menstrual periods, typically occurring 2-3 years after thelarche. (d) All of the above: Since breast development, pubic/axillary hair growth, and menstruation are all key physical changes during puberty, this option is correct.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Breast development involves both glandular tissue proliferation and fat deposition. (a) Estrogen: Primarily responsible for ductal growth, proliferation of breast stroma, and importantly, the deposition of fat in the breasts, contributing to their size and contour during puberty and beyond. (b) Progesterone: Primarily responsible for lobular-alveolar development (glandular tissue differentiation) in preparation for lactation, acting synergistically with estrogen. It has less of a direct role in fat proliferation compared to estrogen. (c) FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone): Acts on the ovaries to stimulate follicle development and estrogen production. It does not directly act on breast fat. (d) Testosterone: While present in females, high levels can inhibit breast development or cause virilization. It does not promote breast fat proliferation.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Menopause is defined by the cessation of ovarian follicular activity, leading to significant hormonal changes. (a) Fall in serum estradiol level: Correct. Ovarian production of estradiol drastically decreases due to follicular depletion. (b) Fall in FSH level: Incorrect (this is the exception). As ovarian function declines and estradiol/inhibin B levels fall, the negative feedback on the pituitary is reduced. This leads to a significant increase in FSH levels, which is a hallmark of menopause. (c) Increase in LH level: Correct. Similar to FSH, LH levels also increase due to reduced negative feedback from the ovaries. (d) Increase level of androgens: This statement is nuanced. Ovarian androgen production (e.g., testosterone, androstenedione) decreases after menopause, but not as dramatically as estrogen. Adrenal androgen production continues. The relative androgenic environment may increase because estrogen falls more significantly, leading to a higher androgen-to-estrogen ratio, which can manifest as some androgenic effects (e.g., hirsutism). However, an absolute increase in total androgen levels is not typical; rather, a relative excess or altered metabolism might occur. The most clearly incorrect statement is the fall in FSH.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Increased facial hair growth (hirsutism) after menopause can occur due to an altered hormonal balance. (a) Fall in FSH level: Incorrect. FSH levels increase during menopause. (b) Increase in LH level: Incorrect. While LH increases, it doesn't directly cause hirsutism. It reflects ovarian failure. (c) Decrease estrogen androgen ratio: Correct. After menopause, ovarian estrogen production plummets. While ovarian androgen production also declines, adrenal androgen production continues, and peripheral conversion of androgens can occur. The significant drop in estrogen relative to the remaining androgens leads to a lower estrogen-to-androgen ratio. This relative androgen excess can stimulate hair follicles in androgen-sensitive areas, leading to increased facial hair. (d) Decrease androgen level: Incorrect. While ovarian androgen production decreases, the total effective androgenic activity relative to estrogen becomes more prominent. An absolute decrease in all androgens wouldn't explain increased hirsutism.</p>

It can be primary (no underlying pelvic pathology) or secondary (due to an underlying condition). (a) Dysmenorrhea due to hydrosalpinx: A hydrosalpinx (fluid-filled, blocked fallopian tube) can cause chronic pelvic pain and potentially dysmenorrhea as part of a broader PID or inflammatory picture. (b) Dysmenorrhea due to endometriosis: Endometriosis is a very common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, often severe. (c) Dysmenorrhea due to uterine septum: Congenital uterine anomalies like a uterine septum can sometimes be associated with dysmenorrhea, though issues like recurrent pregnancy loss are more commonly linked. (d) All of the above: Since all listed conditions can potentially cause or be associated with painful menstruation (dysmenorrhea), this option is correct.

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as painful menstruation in the absence of any identifiable pelvic pathology. It is typically caused by excessive uterine production of prostaglandins, leading to strong uterine contractions and ischemia. (a) Narrowing of the cervical canal (cervical stenosis): This is generally considered a cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, as it is an anatomical obstruction to menstrual flow. (b) Uterine hypoplasia: An underdeveloped uterus might be associated with primary dysmenorrhea or amenorrhea, but the link to primary dysmenorrhea isn't as strong or direct as prostaglandins. It's not typically listed as a direct cause of the pain mechanism in primary dysmenorrhea. (c) Large uterine fibroid: Uterine fibroids are a structural pathology and are a common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, not primary. (d) Increased production of prostaglandins: This is the primary pathophysiological mechanism behind primary dysmenorrhea. Prostaglandins (especially PGF2Î±) cause myometrial contractions and vasoconstriction. (c) is definitively NOT a cause of primary dysmenorrhea; it causes secondary dysmenorrhea.</p>

            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Menorrhagia (Heavy Menstrual Bleeding) can have various causes. (a) Uterine Fibroid (Leiomyoma): A very common cause of HMB, especially submucosal or intramural fibroids that distort the uterine cavity. (b) Adenomyosis: The presence of endometrial tissue within the myometrium, often causes HMB and dysmenorrhea. (c) Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB): An older term, now often encompassed by "Abnormal Uterine Bleeding - Ovulatory Dysfunction (AUB-O)" or AUB-Endometrial (AUB-E) if no structural cause.

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Management of DUB (or AUB without major structural pathology) often involves medical therapies. (a) Contraceptive pills (Combined Oral Contraceptives - COCs): Effective in regulating cycles and reducing menstrual blood loss by suppressing ovulation and thinning the endometrium. This is a hormonal therapy. (b) Norethisterone acetate: A synthetic progestogen. Progestogens (cyclical or continuous) can be used to manage DUB, especially anovulatory bleeding, by stabilizing the endometrium or inducing withdrawal bleeds. This is a hormonal therapy. (c) NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs): E.g., mefenamic acid, ibuprofen. While not "hormonal," they are a common medical therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding. They work by reducing prostaglandin levels in the endometrium, thereby decreasing blood loss and dysmenorrhea. The question asks for "hormonal therapy." (d) All of the above: If the question is interpreted as common medical treatments for DUB where hormonal options are primary, then (a) and (b) are definitely hormonal. Many such questions group effective medical treatments. In the context of first-line medical management of DUB/HMB, COCs, progestogens, and NSAIDs are all frequently listed. Assuming the question intends to list common medical treatments for DUB, and option (d) is the target.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Endometrial ablation is a procedure that destroys the uterine lining to reduce or stop heavy menstrual bleeding. It is generally considered for women who have completed childbearing. (a) Female who is over 35 years: Age itself isn't a strict indication or contraindication, but it's often performed in perimenopausal women. This is a plausible candidate. (b) Female who has completed her family: This is a key indication/prerequisite, as endometrial ablation can cause infertility or make pregnancy very high risk. (c) Female who does not has any significant endometrial pathology such as cancer: Correct. Endometrial cancer or significant atypical hyperplasia must be ruled out before ablation. (d) Female who is newly married: Incorrect (this is the exception/contraindication). A newly married woman is likely to desire future fertility. Endometrial ablation significantly compromises future fertility and is therefore contraindicated in women who wish to conceive.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Vaginitis is inflammation of the vagina. (a) Trichomoniasis: A common STI causing vaginitis, but often less prevalent than candidiasis or BV. (b) Moniliasis (Vulvovaginal Candidiasis - VVC): Yeast infection, caused by Candida species (most commonly C. albicans), is a very common cause of symptomatic vaginitis in women of childbearing age. (c) Atropic vagina (Atrophic vaginitis): Due to estrogen deficiency, typically seen in postmenopausal women, not in the childbearing period unless there's a specific cause for estrogen deficiency (e.g., POI, lactation). (d) Streptococci: Group B Streptococcus can colonize the vagina but is not a common cause of symptomatic vaginitis itself, though it can cause other infections. Aerobic vaginitis can be caused by various bacteria including streptococci but is less common than VVC or BV. Note: Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) is also extremely common, often the most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms/discharge in childbearing women.

(b) Senile vaginitis (Atrophic vaginitis or Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause - GSM): Inflammation of the vagina due to estrogen deficiency after menopause. The vaginal epithelium becomes thin, dry, and fragile, leading to symptoms like dryness, itching, burning, dyspareunia, and sometimes spotting.

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Senile vaginitis (atrophic vaginitis/GSM) is directly caused by the decline in estrogen levels after menopause. (a) Increase FSH level: Increased FSH is a marker of menopause (ovarian failure) but not the direct cause of vaginal atrophy. (b) Estrogen deficiency: Correct. Estrogen is crucial for maintaining the health, thickness, elasticity, and lubrication of the vaginal epithelium. Its deficiency leads to atrophic changes. (c) Malnutrition: Severe malnutrition could potentially affect hormonal balance, but estrogen deficiency due to ovarian failure is the primary cause. (d) Androgen deficiency: While androgens also play a role in female sexual function and tissue health, estrogen deficiency is the predominant cause of atrophic vaginitis.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is an infection of the upper female genital tract. (a) PID is common in females who are menstruating: True. Menstruation can facilitate the ascent of bacteria from the lower genital tract. Also, young, sexually active women are at highest risk. (b) PID is more common in women who are using intra uterine devices (IUDs): True. There is a slightly increased risk of PID, particularly in the first few weeks after IUD insertion, especially if there is a pre-existing lower genital tract infection. (c) PID is more common in women who are taking oral contraceptives: False. Combined oral contraceptives are generally considered to be protective against PID. They thicken cervical mucus (making it harder for bacteria to ascend) and may reduce retrograde menstruation. (d) PID is less common in women having only single sexual partner: True. PID is primarily caused by sexually transmitted infections (like chlamydia and gonorrhea). Having multiple sexual partners increases the risk of acquiring STIs. Monogamy reduces this risk.</p>

            <p class="explanation">Explanation: The uterus is supported by a complex system of ligaments and pelvic floor muscles. (a) Round ligament: Helps maintain anteversion but offers minimal true support against prolapse. (b) Broad ligament: A peritoneal fold that encloses the uterus and related structures, providing some general support and containing blood vessels and nerves. (c) Cervico-vaginal junction: This area is supported by the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments (Level 1 support), which are crucial. The junction itself is part of the supported structures. (d) All of the above: While the degree and type of support vary, all these structures contribute in some way to the position and stability of the uterus. The primary suspensory ligaments (cardinal, uterosacral) are most critical against prolapse, but the round and broad ligaments also play roles in uterine positioning and general support.

            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Genital prolapse occurs due to weakening of pelvic support structures. (a) Postmenopausal atrophy: True. Estrogen deficiency leads to atrophy and weakening of pelvic connective tissues and muscles, increasing prolapse risk. (b) Raised intra-abdominal pressure: True. Chronic conditions that increase intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., chronic cough, constipation, heavy lifting, obesity) strain the pelvic floor. (c) Underweight: Incorrect (this is the exception). Being underweight is generally not a risk factor for prolapse. In contrast, obesity is a significant risk factor. (d) Congenital weakness of the supporting structures of the uterus: True.

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Kartagener syndrome is a subtype of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder affecting ciliary structure and function. (a) Normal sperm production: Spermatogenesis (sperm production) itself might be normal, but the sperm will be immotile or have severely impaired motility. (b) There is loss of ciliary function and sperm motility: Correct. Defective cilia lead to chronic sinopulmonary infections and situs inversus (in about 50% of cases). The sperm flagella (structurally similar to cilia) are also affected, leading to immotile or severely dysmotile sperm and thus male infertility.

(b) Retroverted uterus due to adhesions: While a simple retroverted uterus is usually a normal variant, if it's fixed by adhesions (e.g., from endometriosis or PID), these underlying conditions and associated tubal/ovarian damage can cause infertility. (c) Anteverted uterus: This is the normal anatomical position of the uterus and is not a cause of infertility.

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Various drugs can be used for ovulation induction depending on the cause of anovulation. (a) Clomiphene citrate: An oral selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that stimulates FSH/LH release, commonly used as a first-line agent. (b) FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone): Injectable gonadotropins (containing FSH, sometimes with LH) are used to directly stimulate follicular development, especially if clomiphene fails or for IVF. (c) GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone): Pulsatile GnRH administration (using a pump) can be used to induce ovulation in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea (GnRH deficiency). GnRH agonists and antagonists are also used in IVF protocols but for different purposes (to control the cycle). If "GnRH" here implies pulsatile GnRH for induction, it's valid.

(a) Progesterone therapy: Supplementation with progesterone (e.g., vaginal suppositories, oral micronized progesterone, injections) during the luteal phase is the most common and direct treatment aimed at supporting the endometrium and improving implantation. (b) Oestrogen therapy: Estrogen is important for endometrial proliferation in the follicular phase. While adequate estrogen priming is necessary, estrogen therapy isn't the primary treatment for a progesterone-deficient luteal phase. (c) Antibiotics: Used for infections, not LPD.

            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) involves placing prepared sperm directly into the uterine cavity. (a) Recurrent abortions: Incorrect (this is the exception). Recurrent pregnancy loss has various causes (genetic, anatomical, autoimmune, endocrine) that are not addressed by IUI. IUI's purpose is to facilitate fertilization. (b) Hypospadias: If hypospadias (abnormal urethral opening on the penis) leads to difficulty with normal sperm deposition in the vagina, IUI can be an effective way to bypass this issue. (c) Asthenospermia (Reduced sperm motility): Mild to moderate asthenospermia can be an indication for IUI, as placing sperm closer to the fallopian tubes can improve chances of fertilization. (d) Cervical stenosis (Narrowing of the cervical canal) or hostile cervical mucus: IUI bypasses the cervix, making it a suitable treatment for cervical factor infertility.</p>

            <p class="explanation">Explanation: The question asks for the commonest benign solid tumor. (a) Uterine fibroid (Leiomyoma): These are benign solid tumors of the uterine smooth muscle and are extremely common, affecting a large percentage of women during their reproductive years. (b) Functional ovarian cyst: These (e.g., follicular cyst, corpus luteum cyst) are very common but are cysts (fluid-filled), not solid tumors. (c) Dermoid cyst (Mature cystic teratoma): A common benign ovarian germ cell tumor. While it contains solid elements (hair, teeth, fat, bone), it is predominantly cystic. (d) Cervical cancer: This is a malignant tumor, not benign. Therefore, uterine fibroids are the commonest benign solid tumors in females.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Uterine fibroids are estrogen-dependent tumors. (a) Postmenopausal women: Fibroids typically shrink after menopause due to estrogen withdrawal, though they can persist. They are not "more common" in this group in terms of development. (b) Nulliparous women: Nulliparity (never having given birth) is a recognized risk factor for developing uterine fibroids. Pregnancy seems to have a somewhat protective effect. (c) Multiparty (Multiparity): Parity is generally considered protective, not a risk factor. (d) After 35 years of age: The prevalence of fibroids increases with age throughout the reproductive years, peaking around perimenopause. So, women after 35 (and into their 40s) have a high prevalence. Nulliparity is a distinct risk factor category.</p>

            <p class="explanation">Explanation: While fibroids can cause various symptoms or be asymptomatic: (a) Menorrhagia (Heavy Menstrual Bleeding - HMB): This is the most common symptom associated with uterine fibroids, especially those that distort the uterine cavity (submucosal, intramural). (b) Pain in lower abdomen: Can occur, especially with large fibroids, pressure symptoms, or during degeneration (e.g., red degeneration). It can be chronic pelvic pain. (c) Dysmenorrhea (Painful menstruation): Also common, particularly with intramural or submucosal fibroids. (d) Purulent vaginal discharge: Not a typical symptom of fibroids themselves. It suggests infection. While pain and dysmenorrhea are common, heavy menstrual bleeding is often cited as the hallmark or most classical presenting symptom.</p>

(a) Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs): Used continuously or cyclically to induce a pseudopregnancy state, leading to decidualization and atrophy of endometrial implants, and reducing pain. (b) Progesterone (Progestogens): E.g., medroxyprogesterone acetate, dienogest, norethisterone. They cause decidualization and atrophy of endometrial tissue and suppress ovulation. (c) GnRH analogues (agonists or antagonists): Create a hypoestrogenic state (medical menopause) by downregulating or blocking pituitary GnRH receptors, thus suppressing ovarian estrogen production and causing atrophy of implants. (d) All of the above: COCPs, progestogens, and GnRH analogues are all established hormonal treatments for endometriosis-associated pain. NSAIDs are used for pain relief, and other agents like aromatase inhibitors may be used in refractory cases.</p>

Surgical staging is not the primary method for initial staging, though surgical findings can refine prognostic information. (a) Severity of symptoms: Symptoms can correlate with stage but are not the primary basis for formal staging. (b) Age of female: Age is a demographic factor but not a staging criterion. (c) Examination under general anesthesia (EUA): Often performed as part of the clinical staging process to accurately assess tumor size, parametrial involvement, and vaginal extension, especially if a thorough bimanual exam is difficult in an awake patient. This is a component of clinical staging. Other components include colposcopy, biopsy, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, and imaging (e.g., chest X-ray, IVP, CT, MRI, PET-CT as allowed by FIGO for staging). (d) All of the above: Incorrect because symptoms and age are not direct staging criteria. The primary basis is a thorough clinical assessment, which may include EUA, biopsies, and specific imaging studies as defined by FIGO.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Ovarian tumors are classified based on their cell of origin. (a) Epithelial tumor: These are the most common type of ovarian tumors overall, and their incidence increases with age. In postmenopausal women (like a 63-year-old), epithelial ovarian cancers (e.g., serous, mucinous, endometrioid carcinomas) are the most common malignant ovarian tumors. Benign epithelial tumors (e.g., serous/mucinous cystadenomas) are also common. (b) Germ cell tumor: More common in younger women and adolescents (e.g., teratomas, dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumors). (c) Sex cord tumor: This is an incomplete term. "Sex cord-stromal tumors" (e.g., granulosa cell tumors, fibromas, thecomas, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors) can occur at various ages, but epithelial tumors are more common overall in older women. (d) Stromal tumor: Part of the sex cord-stromal category. Given the age, epithelial tumors (both benign and malignant) are by far the most common type.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">Explanation: Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) contain estrogen and a progestogen. (a) is the prevention of ovulation: Correct. The primary mechanism is the suppression of gonadotropin (FSH and LH) secretion from the pituitary gland, mainly through the negative feedback effect of the progestogen (and to a lesser extent, estrogen). This prevents follicular development and inhibits the LH surge, thereby preventing ovulation. (b) Progestogen-positive feedback works at the hypothalamus to increase the pulse frequency of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone: Incorrect. Progestogens in COCPs exert negative feedback, suppressing GnRH and gonadotropin release. Positive feedback (by estrogen) occurs mid-cycle to trigger the LH surge in a natural cycle, which COCPs aim to prevent. (c) They increase the mucus production of the cervix: Incorrect. COCPs, particularly the progestogen component, thicken cervical mucus, making it more hostile to sperm penetration. This is a secondary mechanism. They don't typically "increase" the quantity of fertile-type mucus. (d) They increase the lining endometrium thickness: Incorrect. COCPs generally cause the endometrium to become thinner, less glandular, and less receptive to implantation (decidualized and atrophic with prolonged use). This is another secondary mechanism.</p>

            <p class="explanation">Explanation: A rectovaginal fistula (RVF) is an abnormal connection between the rectum and the vagina. (a) Obstetrical cause: This is the most common cause worldwide, particularly in areas with limited access to obstetric care. Obstetric trauma, such as severe perineal lacerations (third- and fourth-degree tears) during vaginal delivery, or complications from prolonged/obstructed labor, can lead to RVF. (b) Radiation: Pelvic radiation therapy (e.g., for cervical, rectal, or anal cancer) can cause tissue damage and fistula formation, but it's less common than obstetric causes overall. (c) Carcinoma: Invasive cancers of the rectum, vagina, cervix, or anus can directly erode into adjacent structures and form a fistula. This is a serious but less frequent cause than obstetric trauma. (d) Endometriosis: Severe, deep infiltrating endometriosis involving the rectovaginal septum can rarely lead to fistula formation, but it's an uncommon cause. Inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease) is another important non-obstetric cause. Given the options, obstetric trauma remains the most prevalent cause globally.</p>
